1. $$\sin(-\theta)=-\sin \theta$$
2. $$\cos(-\theta)=\cos \theta$$
3. $$\tan(-\theta)=-\tan \theta$$
4. $$\csc(-\theta)=-\csc \theta$$
5. $$\sec(-\theta)=\sec \theta$$
6. $$\cot(-\theta)=\cot \theta$$

>To prove these identities, just think about the [[UnitCircle.png]]. A degree of $30\degree$ of $\sin(-\theta)$ would flip across the Y-Axis and be the same as $-\sin \theta$ whereas if you did that with $\cos(-\theta)$ it would flip across the Y-Axis and... remain positive X because it didn't flip across the X-Axis.
