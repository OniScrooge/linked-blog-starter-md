>Identities are equations that are true for ALL values.

Ex.) $3(x+9)=3x+27$ is an identity. It is true for all values of $x$.

So no matter what number you substitute $x$ for in this equation, it will work out just fine.

Reciprocal of a non-zero number $x$ is $\frac{1}{x}$ (Just turn it upside down :D)

Since, $\sin \theta=\frac{y}{r}$ and $\csc \theta=\frac{r}{y}$  we can see that $\sin \theta$ $\csc \theta$ are **reciprocals** of one another. This means we can say $\sin \theta=\frac{1}{\csc \theta}$ and $\csc \theta=\frac{1}{\sin \theta}$.

>[!faq]- Is $\tan \theta=-2$ and $\cot \theta=-2$ possible?
>No. The statement is impossible, because $\tan \theta=\frac{1}{\cot \theta}$, so there's no way that if $\tan \theta=-2$ could have it's reciprocal be anything other than $\cot \theta=-\frac{1}{2}$.

This leads us to [[Reciprocal Identities]].

>[!faq]- If $\cos \theta=\frac{1}{3}$ find $\sec \theta$.
>
>Well, $\sec \theta$ is just the reciprocal of $\cos$ so it equals $\frac{3}{1}$ or just 3.

>[!note]
>Signs of trig functions r is a distance from the origin to a point (x, y) and as such is always positive. $r>0$ in every quadrant.

> All others not listed as positive are of course negative

>[!faq]- What is the sign of $\sin \theta 321 \degree$?
>
>It's just asking you if the angle is negative or positive. So what is a $\sin$ at angle $321$? Well just look at the chart and it is in quadrant IV which all sines in there are negative.
>
>So the answer is negative. *Simple, right?*

>[!faq]- Suppose that $-90\degree<\theta<90\degree$. Find the sign of the function value $\sec(-\theta)$. (Negative or Positive)?
>It's positive
>
>Because the suppose means it's between Quadrant 4 & 1, in which SECANT is always positive. Don't be fooled by the $-\theta$, it doesn't change a thing.

You might get a question that goes far beyond the normal degree of a circle such as $2471\degree$ and all you have to do is keep subtracting $360\degree$ until you get a angle inside a circle. In this case it's $311\degree$ and the answer to that for $\cos$ would be positive.

Range(output) of trig functions:

| Trig function | Range |
| ---- | ---- |
| SIN | [-1, 1] |
| COS | [-1, 1] |
| TAN | [-INF, INF] |
| COT | [-INF, INF] |
| CSC | (-INF, -1]U[1, INF) |
| SEC | (-INF, -1]U[1, INF) |

>[!note]
>The 'U' in the chart means *union* which is a gap between -1 & 1 that is not included as part of it's range.

>[!faq]- Decide if these are possible or impossible. $\cos \theta=.76$ and $\cos \theta=1.76$
>1st is possible as it is between -1 & 1
>2nd is impossible as is not between -1 & 1
>
> Just look at the chart above, simple.

>[!faq]- Suppose $\theta$ is in QIII and $\tan \theta=\frac{8}{5}$. Find the other 5 trig functions. **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO DRAW THIS OUT**
>It's in QIII and TAN is negative there, so your values of _X_ and _Y_ will be negative.
>x = -5
>y = -8
>r = $\sqrt{ 89 }$
>
>And then just solve for the other trig functions with this information.
> $\sin = \frac{-8\sqrt{ 89 }}{89}$
> $\cos=\frac{-5\sqrt{ 89 }}{89}$
> $\tan=\frac{8}{5}$
> $\csc=\frac{-\sqrt{ 89 }}{8}$
> $\sec=\frac{-\sqrt{ 89 }}{5}$
> $\cot=\frac{5}{8}$

You will need the [[Pythagorean Identities]].
>[!note]
>$\cos^2\theta$ is the same as $(\cos \theta)^2$.

>[!faq]- Given $\cos \theta=\frac{-\sqrt{ 2 }}{3}$ and $\theta$ in QIV, find $\sin \theta$ using Pythagorean Identities.
>Use [[Pythagorean Identities]] in this case use [[Pythagorean Identities#^ff3cac]]
>
>$(\frac{-\sqrt{ 2 }}{3})^2+\sin^2\theta=1$
>
>$\frac{2}{9}+\sin^2\theta=1$
>
>$\sqrt{ \sin^2\theta }=\pm\sqrt{ \frac{7}{9} }$
>
>But only one answer. Pick sign according to quadrant, which in this case is QIV and it is looking for COSINE so it must be positive.
>
>$\cos \theta=-\frac{\sqrt{ 7 }}{3}$

>[!note]
>If you don't like this method, you can always just plot these points on a triangle on a graph and plot the points. Either using Pythagorean Identities or graphs is fine.

The others needed here will be the [[Quotient Identities]].
Which can easily be remembered by them being the only two that involve *quotients*of fellow Trigonometric Functions like SINE, COSINE, COSECANT, and SECANT.

>[!faq]- Use identities to find $\tan \theta$ in QI if $\cos \theta=\frac{3}{8}$.
>Use [[Pythagorean Identities#^ff3cac]]
>And just plug it in
>$(\frac{3}{8})^2+\sin^2\theta=1$
>$\frac{9}{64}+\sin^2\theta=1$
>$\sqrt{ \sin^2\theta }=\sqrt{ \frac{55}{64} }$
>$\sin \theta=\frac{\sqrt{ 55 }}{8}$
>And then just use that to solve for TANGENT with [[Quotient Identities#^685197]]

>[!faq]- Find the least positive value of $\theta$ for the formula $\cos(4\theta+10\degree)\sec(5\theta-3\degree)=1$.
>
>To solve this, first recall the reciprocal relationship between COS & SEC [[Reciprocal Identities#^df8640]].
>
>Now manipulate it so you have the same Trigonometric Function and plug them in:
>$\cos(4\theta+10\degree)*\frac{1}{\cos(5\theta-3\degree)}=1$
>
>Simplified as:
>
>$\frac{\cos(4\theta+10\degree)}{\cos(5\theta-3\degree)}=1$
>
>Multiply by the denominator to get them separate:
>
>$\cos(4\theta+10\degree)=\cos(5\theta-3\degree)$
>
>The $\cos$ cancel each other out
>
>$4\theta+10\degree=5\theta-3\degree$
>
>Subtract the theta and add the 3 to each other side to finish solving
>
>$\theta=13$
