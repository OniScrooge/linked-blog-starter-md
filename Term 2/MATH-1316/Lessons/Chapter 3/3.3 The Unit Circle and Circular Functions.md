>[!info] The beginning
>This is where you will need to memorize the Unit Circle ![[UnitCircle.png]]
>So far, we have defined the six trig functions so that the domain of each were angles in standard position. They can be measured in _degrees_ or *radians*.
>
>In the future, we will need the domains to be _real numbers_ instead of _angles_. To do this we use the relationship between an angle $\theta$ and an arc length _S_ on a circle.
>
>From [[3.2 Applications of Radian Measure]] we know that $s=r\theta$ which gives $\frac{s}{r}=\theta$
>
>Using a circle with radius 1, the unit circle, we will now have $s=\theta$
>Where s = Arc Length and $\theta$ = angle in radians

>[!note] Know:
>A circle with radius 1, centered at the origin has equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$

>[!abstract] Trig Functions on the [[UnitCircle.png]]
>Trigonometric Functions of angle $\theta$ in radians found by choosing a point (x,y) on the unit circle, can now be rewritten as functions of arc length __S__, a real number on the unit circle.
>
>They will now be called _Circular Functions_.

>Note that: 
> >Each denominator goes 6, 4, 3.
> >Quadrant 1 numerator is just $(\pi)$
> >Quadrant 2 numerator is just $denominator-1(\pi)$
> >Quadrant 3 numerator is just $denominator+1(\pi)$
> >Quadrant 4 numerator is just $2*denominator-1(\pi)$

>[!note] Circular Functions
>For any real number s represented by a direct are on the unit circle.
>$\sin S=y$
>$\cos S=x$
>$\tan S=\frac{y}{x}$
>$\csc S=\frac{1}{y}$
>$\sec S=\frac{1}{x}$
>$\cot S=\frac{x}{y}$

>[!faq]- TanS = 1 on $\left[ \pi,\frac{3\pi}{2} \right]$
>Which means that it is looking for $\frac{y}{x}=1$
>Which also means that $y=x$
>This happens at $225\degree$
>$225\degree$ is $\frac{5\pi}{4}$ and that is your answer

>[!faq]- Approximate $\sin$ of $0.5554$ and round to the nearest fourth place.
>Use your calculator in _radians_.
>
>Your answer should be .527283 rounded to .5273
>

>[!faq]- Find the exact values of __s__ in the interval $[-2\pi,\pi)$ that satisfy the condition $3\cot^{2}s=1$.
>First, $3\cot^{2}s=1$ is the same as $\cot s=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 3 }}$
>
>Next, recall that $\cot \frac{\pi}{3}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 3 }}$
>
>Then just find all the positions where that is true.
>
>All of the positions between $-2\pi,\pi$ are: $-\frac{5\pi}{3},-\frac{4\pi}{3},-\frac{2\pi}{3},-\frac{\pi}{3},\frac{\pi}{3},\frac{2\pi}{3}$
