>[!note] Radian Measure
>An angle with its vertex at the center of a circle the intercepts an arc on the circle, equal in length to the radius of the circle, has a measure of 1 **Radian**.
>![[radian-measure.png]]
>
>Angle measure of 2 radians intercepts an arc on the circle at a length of 2 times the radius. If you haven't guess already, this is leading to $2\pi R$

>[!info] In general...
>If $\theta$ is a central angle of a circle or radius **r** and $\theta$ intercepts an arc of length **s**, then the radian measure of $\theta=\frac{s}{r}$.
>Hint: **s** is often used for length.

>[!note] Converting between degrees and radians
>Know the circumference of a circle, or $2\pi R$. To find the *radian measure* of a circle of radius **r** for one complete revolution we have:
>Arc length of a whole circle$$\theta=\frac{2\pi r}{r}$$
>So this is radian measure of one revolution$$\theta=2\pi$$
>This means that $360\degree=2\pi$ radians. They are the _SAME_ and this leads us to:
>$180\degree=\pi$ Radians
>$90\degree=\frac{\pi}{2}$ Radians
>And so on, and so forth...
>
>Degrees to radians:
>	Multiply degrees by $\frac{\pi}{180}$ to get radians.
>
>Radians to degrees:
>	Multiply radians by $\frac{180}{\pi}$ to get degrees.

>**Don't put this in your calculator, the $\pi$ will be part of the answer.**

>[!faq]- Convert to radians. Leave $\pi$ as part of the answer: $30\degree=?$
>Degrees to radians so use $\frac{\pi}{180}$ formula.
>$30*\frac{\pi}{180}$
>$\pi \frac{30}{180}$
>$\frac{\pi 1}{6}$
>$\frac{\pi}{6}$

>_Simple, right?_

>[!faq]- Convert to degrees. $\frac{-8\pi}{5}$:
>Use the opposite formula. Don't be alarmed by the negative, nothing odd should happen, you're just gonna get a negative answer.
>$\frac{-8\pi}{5}=\frac{-8}{5}*\frac{180}{\pi}=-288$

>[!faq]- Convert $174\degree 50'$ to radians. Round to the nearest hundreth.
>This odd question just means that they **DO** want you to include the $\pi$ when you calculate your answer.
>$174\degree 50'=\left( 174+\frac{50}{60} \right)*\frac{\pi}{180}$
>3.05rad

>If you ever see __ROUND__ in the question, that is the only time you put the $\pi$ in your calculator.

>[!note]
>If no unit of measurement is specified, then the angle is understood to be in _radians_. Pay __CAREFUL__ attention to which unit you are using, they __WILL__ try to trick you with something so simple.

**MEMORIZE** but to be fair, it's basically the [[UnitCircle.png]]

>[!faq]- Find the exact value without a calculator. $\cos \frac{\pi}{6}$:
>We know that $\frac{\pi}{6}$ on the [UnitCIrcle.png] is $30\degree$
>And now you have the question of what is $\cos30\degree=?$
>So the answer is $\frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2}$
>
>Don't forget to check which quadrant you are in to tell if the answer will be negative or not.
>Simple, right?

>[!faq]- Find the exact value. $\sin\frac{-13\pi}{3}$:
>Convert that to a degree using the formula $r*180$
>and you get $\sin-780\degree$
>
>Get it into standard position:
>$\sin-60\degree$
>
>Find $\sin-60\degree$:
>$-\frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2}$
