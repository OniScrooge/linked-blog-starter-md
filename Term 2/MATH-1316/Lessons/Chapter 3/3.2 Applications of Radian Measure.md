>[!note] Arc length
>$s=r\theta$ where $\theta$ is in radians
>![[arc-length.jpg]]

>[!faq]- Find the exact length of the arc(**S**) intercepted by a given central angle. Given: $\theta=\frac{\pi}{3}$ and radius = 12.
>So **S**=$r\theta$
>$=12\left( \frac{\pi}{3} \right)$
>$=4\pi$

>[!faq]- Find the arc length to 3 sig. digs. Given: r = 12.3cm and $\theta=\frac{2\pi}{3}$
>Include the $\pi$ in your calculations
>$S=r\theta$
>$=12.3*\frac{2\pi}{3}$
>$=25.8$

>[!note] Latitude
>Latitude gives the measure of a central angle with vertex at the Earth's center, whose initial side goes through the equator and whose terminal side goes through a given location. It's like you're taking a cross-section of the Earth.

>[!faq]- Find the distance in _Km_ between Farmsville, CA $36\degree N$ and Penticon, B.C. $49\degree N$. Assume they lie on the same side north-south line. Use 6400km for the radius of the Earth.
>Draw a circle with one line going from the center across to the edge labeled 6400km.
>Above that line, draw 2 more for your 2 angles for each city.
>The arc length you'll be finding is the distance between those 2 lines using the arc length formula.
>$s=6400*(49\degree-36\degree)*\frac{\pi}{180}$
>$s=6400*13\degree*\frac{\pi}{180}$ Which will change it to radians
>$=1500km$ after sig. digs.

>[!faq]- Find the distance between $45\degree N$ and $34\degree S$
>Note that the notation tells you which direction you'll draw each respective line, north and south.
>This will also affect your formula as you will have to add the degrees because they separate themselves further.
>$s=r\theta$
>$6400*(45+34)*\frac{\pi}{180}$
>$6400*79*\frac{\pi}{180}$
>$=8800km$ after sig. digs.

>[!note] Area of a Sector of a Circle
>Where $\theta$ is in radians, the formula is: $$A=\frac{1}{2}r^{2}\theta$$

>[!faq]- Find the area of a the sector with the r = 59.8km and $\theta=\frac{2\pi}{3}$ radians
>Just plug it into the formula: $$A=\frac{1}{2}(59.8)^{2}\left( \frac{2\pi}{3} \right)$$
>A = $3744.82km^{2}$

>[!faq]- Find the area of sector with r = 18.3 and $\theta=125\degree$
>It's in degrees first so you'll need to convert using the $\frac{\pi}{180}$ formula
>$$A=\frac{1}{2}(18.3)^{2}*(125)*\left( \frac{\pi}{180} \right)$$
>$A=365.31m^{2}$

>[!faq]- The Ford Model A had a single windshield wiper on the driver's side. The total arm and blade was 10in and swept an arc of $95\degree$. The blade was 7in. So the area of the region cleaned is what?
>You can draw this out if you like, or it helps.
>Remember, you don't need that 3in that the blade won't be hitting where the handle lies.
>Remember to convert from degrees.
>The formula should be $\frac{1}{2}(10-3)^{2}(95)\left( \frac{\pi}{180} \right)$

>[!faq]- A frequent problem in surveying city lots and rural lands adjacent to curves of highways and railways is that of finding the area when one or more of the boundary lines is the arc of a circle. Find the area of the lot shown in the figure.        ![[HW3.2_19.png]]
>Notice that the region can be broken into a sector of a circle and a triangle. Find the areas of the two piecesâ€‹ separately, then add them to find the total area.
>
>The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}(50)(120)=3000yd^{2}$
>
>The area of a sector of a circle of radius r and central angle $\theta$ is given by the following.
>
>$A=\frac{1}{2}r^{2}\theta$
>
>In order to use this formula, the value of $\theta$ must be in radians. So convert $60\degree$ to radians.
>$\theta=60\left( \frac{\pi}{180} \right)=\frac{\pi}{3}$
>
>Notice that the radius of the circle is also the hypotenuse of the right triangle. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the radius of the circle.
>
>$c^{2}=(50)^{2}+(120)^{2}$
>$c^{2}=16900$
>$c=130$
>
>The area of the circle will be as follows:
>$A=\frac{1}{2}(130)^{2}\frac{\pi}{3}$
>$A=\frac{8450\pi}{3}$
>$A=8848.819$
>
>Finally, the total area of the region will be:
>$Area = 3000 + 8848.819$
>$Area \approx 11849$
