>[!note] Summary of inverse functions
> 1. In a 1-to-1 function, each __x__-value corresponds to only one __y__-value and each __y__-value corresponds to only one __x__-value.
> 2. If __f__ is 1-to-1 then __f__ has an inverse function $f^{-1}$
> 3. The domain of __f__ is the range of $f^{-1}$ and the range of __f__ is the domain of $f^{-1}$
> 4. The graph of __f__ and $f^{-1}$ are reflections of one another across the line $y=x$
> 5. To find  $f^{-1}(x)$ from $f(x)$:
> > a. Exchange __x__ 's and __y__ 's
> > b. Solve for __y__
> > c. Replace __y__ with $f^{-1}(x)$

>[!note] Inverse Sine Function
>Written as $y=\sin^{-1}x$ or $y=\arcsin x$
>The first means $x=\sin y$, for $-\frac{\pi}{2}\leq y\leq \frac{\pi}{2}$
>We have to restrict the domain of $y=\sin x$ to $\left[ -\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2} \right]$ because otherwise it is not 1-to-1.
>Quadrant: 1 & 4

>[!faq]- Graph inverse sine function: $y=\sin^{-1}x$
>Input of inverse sine is function value from sine.
>Output of inverse sine are the angles.
>
>We are restricting $y=\sin x$ to the domain: $\left[ -\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2} \right]$ which means that the range of $\sin^{-1}$ is $\left[ -\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2} \right]$
>Know that the range of sine is $[-1,1]$ so the domain of $\sin^{-1}$ is $[-1,1]$
>![[inverse-sine-graph.png]]
>
>The inverse sine function is increasing and continuous on its domain of $[-1,1]$
>The __x__ and __y__ intercept are at $(0,0)$
>It is symmetric with respect to the origin
>It is an odd function, so $\sin^{-1}(-x)=-\sin^{-1}(x)$

>[!info] Inverse Cosine Fuction
>Written as $y=\cos^{-1}x$ or $y=\arccos x$
>Domain: $[-1,1]$
>Range: $[0,\pi]$
>Quadrant: 1 & 2

>[!faq]- Graph Inverse Cosine Function
>
>![[Inverse-Cosine-function.png]]
>
>Inverse cosine is decreasing and continuous on its domain
>__x__-intercept is 1 and __y__-intercept is $\frac{\pi}{2}$
>Has no __y__-axis or origin symmetry

>[!info] Inverse Tangent Function
>Written as $y=\tan^{-1}x$ or $y=\arctan x$
>Domain: $(-\infty,\infty)$
>Range: $\left[ -\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2} \right]$
>Quadrant: 1 & 4

>[!faq]- Graph Inverse Tangent Function
>![[arctan-graph.png]]
>It has horizontal asymptotes of $y=-\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $y=\frac{\pi}{2}$
>Increasing  and continuous on its domain
>__x__ & __y__ intercepts are at $(0,0)$
>Symmetry with respect to origin, so it is odd and $\tan^{-1}(-x)=-\tan^{-1}(x)$

>[!info] Inverse Cosecant Function
>Domain: $(-\infty,-1]U[1,\infty)$
>Range: $\left[ -\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2} \right]$
>Quadrants: 1 & 4

>[!info] Inverse Secant Function
>Domain: $(-\infty,-1]U[1,\infty)$
>Range: $-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}$
>Quadrants: 1 & 2

>[!info] Inverse Cotangent Function
>Domain: $(-\infty,\infty)$
>Range: $(0,\pi)$
>Quadrants: 1 & 2

>[!faq]- Find the exact value of __y__ without a calculator: $y=\cos^{-1}\frac{1}{2}$
>The formula $y=\cos^{-1}\frac{1}{2}$ is just the inverse of $\cos \frac{1}{2}$.
>So what you can do is find the exact value of the angle in which _COSINE_ is equal to $\frac{1}{2}$ within it's range.
>The only angle in which COSINE is equal to $\frac{1}{2}$ is at $\frac{\pi}{3}$
>
>So, the answer is $y=\frac{\pi}{3}$

>[!note] Note
>When you are given an inverse, they are only asking for __ONE__ angle. That answer is also wanted in radians.

>[!faq]- Find the exact __y__ value without a calculator: $\sin^{-1}\left( \frac{-\sqrt{ 3 }}{2} \right)=y$
>Think: $\sin y=\frac{-\sqrt{ 3 }}{2}$
>
>Same procedure as before, find where on the [[UnitCircle.png]] that meets the formula.
>
>Which is: $y=\frac{-\pi}{3}$

>[!faq]- Find the exact __y__ value without a calculator: $\sec^{-1}(-\sqrt{ 2 })=y$
>If you encounter a problem that contains __COSECANT__, __SECANT__, or __COTANGENT__, then you __CAN__ use the reciprocal to help make it easier.
>$\cos^{-1}(\frac{1}{-\sqrt{ 2 }})=y$
>$\cos^{-1}(-\frac{\sqrt{ 2 }}{ 2 })=y$
>
>And then solve that function, which equals $y=\frac{3\pi}{4}$

>[!faq]- Find the exact __y__ value without a calculator: $y=\sec^{-1}x$
>This could be rewritten as $\sec y=x$
>Then converted to COSINE
>$\frac{1}{\cos y}=x$
>
>Now you could use that to make it simpler

>[!note] Working with Cotangent functions
>Be careful when using your calculator to take the inverse cotangent of a negative quantity. You have to enter the inverse _tangent_ of the reciprocal of the negative quantity, which will give the answer in __Quadrant 4__, but _cotangent_ of a negative is defined in __Quadrant 2__. So, add $\pi$ or 180 degrees to adjust it to the correct quadrant.

>[!faq]- Use a calculator to find the solution in degrees. Round to three decimal places: $\theta=\cos^{-1}(-.133488)$
>Put it in the calculator, in degree mode, in approximate, and you should get: $\theta=97.671\degree$
