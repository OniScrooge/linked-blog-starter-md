>[!note] Law of Cosines
>In any $\triangle ABC$ with sides a, b, c.
>$a^2=b^2+c^2-2bc\cos A$
>$b^2=a^2+c^2-2ac\cos B$
>$c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\cos C$
>![[law-of-cosines.png]]
>Law of Cosines needs either SAS or SSS
>
>This is effectively the Pythagorean Theorem for non-right triangles

>[!faq]- Find the missing value: $A=60\degree,a=?,b=3,c=8$
>Plug it in to the formula for whatever is missing.
>$x^2=3^2+8^2-2(3)(8)\cos60\degree$
>$x^2=49$
>
>And you get:$x=7$

>[!note] Not all equations will be perfect
>Some of the equations that you will be given are not in perfect arrangement, and will need you to simplify them before you can put them in the calculator.

>[!faq]- Find all missing values
>$a=?$ $A=61\degree$
>$b=6$ $B=?$
>$c=4$ $C=?$
>
>Find a
>$a^2=4^2+6^2-2(4)(6)\cos 61\degree$ 
>$a^2=28.729$
>$a=5.4$
>
>Find B with [[Law of Sines]]
>$$\frac{5.4}{\sin 61}=\frac{6}{\sin B}$$
>$B=76.4\degree$

>Find C
>$180-61+76.4=42.6$

>[!faq]- The sides of a parallelogram are $4.0$ and $6.0$. One angle is $58\degree$ and the other is $122\degree$. Find the lengths of the diagonals of the parallelogram.
>Note that a parallelogram is a 4 sided shape. This is something that you can still work with by drawing a line from edge to edge to make 2 triangles.
>
>Follow your normal procedures to get the side you need.
