>[!note] Oblique Triangles
>A triangle that is not a right triangle is called an __oblique triangle__.
>
>The measures of the three sides can be found if at least one side and two other measures are known.
>
>The data required for solving __oblique triangles__:
>Case 1 - One side and two angles are known(SAA or AAS).
>Case 2 - Two sides and one angle that is not between the sides are known(SSA). This version may lead to more than one _triangle_.
>Case 3 - Two sides and the angle between them are known(SAS).
>Case 4 -  Three sides are known(SSS).

>[!info] The Law of Sines
>In any triangle of __A B C__ with sides __a b c__:
>$$\frac{a}{\sin A}=\frac{b}{\sin B}=\frac{c}{\sin C}$$
>When you know two angles and one side of a triangle, you can use __The Law of Sines__ and there will be exactly one solution.

>Simple to find the last angle: $180-45-105=30$
>With this you can plug it into the __Law of Sines__
>$$\frac{b}{\sin B}=\frac{a}{\sin A}$$
>$$\frac{10}{\sin30}=\frac{a}{\sin45}$$
>$\frac{1}{2}*a=10*\frac{\sqrt{ 2 }}{2}$
>
>Which solves to: $a=10\sqrt{ 2 }$

>[!faq]- To find the distance __RS__ across a canyon, a distance __TR__ is measured at __582yd__. Then angle __T__ is found to be at $32\degree50'$ and __R__ is $102\degree20'$. Find __RS__.
>First, plot your points with the information given.
>Now you need to find the distance from __R__ to __S__ which will be referred to as __X__.
>
>The only side that you know is 582 but you don't have the angle paired with it, so find that angle.
>$180-32\degree50'-102\degree20'=44\degree50'$
>
>Now you can set up your __Sines__ with __X__ going with the $32\degree 50'$
>$$\frac{582}{\sin44\degree50'}=\frac{x}{\sin32\degree50'}$$
>$582\sin32\degree 50'=x\sin 44\degree 50'$
>
>$x=RS=448yd$
>_Simple, right?_

>[!note] Area of Oblique Triangles
>If you know two sides with the angle between, we can find the area of an __oblique triangle__.
>
>In any $\triangle ABC$, the area __a__ is given by: __a__$=\frac{1}{2}bc\sin A=\frac{1}{2}ac\sin B=\frac{1}{2}ab\sin C$ aka $\frac{1}{2}*side_{1}*side_{2}*\sin$(angle between sides)

>[!faq]- Find the area of the $\triangle$ with: $C=72.2\degree$, $b=43.8$ft, and $a=35.1$ft
>__a__$=\frac{1}{2}(43.8)*(35.1)*\sin(72.2)$
>
>__a__$=732$ft$^2$
