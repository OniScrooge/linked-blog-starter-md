>[!note] The Ambiguous Law of Sines
>If you are given a $\triangle$ with two sides and an angle not between them(SSA), you will still use __The Law of Sines__, but there may be no $\triangle$, $1\triangle$, or $2\triangle$ depending on how it is set up.
>
>If the side opposite the given angle is less than the side attached, there will be 0 or 2 triangles. We will see which one through calculations.
>![[ambiguous-law-of-sines.png]]
>
>If the side opposite the given angle is greater than the side attached, there will be $1\triangle$ for SSA.
>
>__REMEMBER__: AAS, SAA, ASA uses The Law of Sines and has 1 solution.

>[!faq]- Solve the $\triangle$ for: $A=29.7\degree,b=41.5ft,a=27.2ft$
>Notice that the side opposite attached, so there will be either 0 or $2\triangle$
>Use The Law of Sines to decide how many.
>
>$\frac{27.2}{\sin29.7}=\frac{41.5}{\sin B}$ Formulate
>$27.2\sin B=41.5\sin 29.7$ Rearrange
>
>Solve in calculator: $49.1\degree$
>Which is a real number, so that means there are $2\triangle$. If there had been an error in the calculator, there would've been 0.
>
>Since you now know that there are 2 answers, the solution for $B\to B_{1}$.
>
>Solve the first $\triangle$ by finding __c__ and __C__.
> >$C=180-29.7-49.1=101.2\degree$
> >
> >For __c__ The Law of Sines is required.
> >$$\frac{c}{\sin101.2}=\frac{27.2}{\sin 29.7}$$
> >$c*\sin 29.7=27.2*\sin 101.2$
> >
> >$C_{1}=53.9ft$
>
>Now find the second $\triangle$
> >$B_{2}$ is found, in this case, by $180-49.1=130.9$
> >$C_{2}=19.4$
> >
> >And then you can use The Law of Sines to find the rest.
> >$$\frac{C_{2}}{\sin 19.4}=\frac{27.2}{\sin 29.7}$$
> >$C_{2}=18.2ft$

>[!note] Within the range
>If you do your calculations and receive an answer outside the range of SINE for example $[-1,1]$ such as $1.392...$ then that means there is no solution, or no $\triangle$.
