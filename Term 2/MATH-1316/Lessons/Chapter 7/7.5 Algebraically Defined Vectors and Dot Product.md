>The positive angle between the x-axis and a position vector is the direction angle for the vector.

>The _magnitude_(length) of the vector $\vec{u}= <a,b>$ is calculated as $\vec{u}=\sqrt{ a^2+b^2 }$.

>The _direction angle_ $\theta$ satisfies $\tan \theta=\frac{b}{a}$ where $a\neq 0$.

>Sometimes we will have to adjust the angle according to the quadrant.

>Direction angle:
>$\tan \theta=\frac{2}{9}$
>$\tan^{-1}\left( \frac{2}{9} \right)$
>$\theta \approx 12.5$

>[!note] Direction angle
>The angle __MUST__ be positive. You might encounter coordinates that give you a negative result when you find their inverse _TAN_, but all you need to do is find what that is from the whole circle.

>$\tan^{-1}\left( \frac{b}{a} \right)+360\degree=\theta$ To get the __POSITIVE__ direction angle.

>[!info] Vectors
>The horizontal and vertical components, respectively of a vector $\vec{u}$ with magnitude $|\vec{u}|$ and a direction angle $\theta$ are given by $a=|\vec{u}|\cos \theta$ and $b=|\vec{u}|\sin \theta$.
>
>In other words $\vec{u}= <a,b> = <|\vec{u}|\cos \theta,|\vec{u}|\sin \theta>$

>[!faq]- Vector $\vec{w}$ has magnitude of 38 and direction of $72\degree$. Find the horizontal and vertical components.
>Just plug into the formulas and solve:

>$\approx 36.1$

>All that's being asked here is for you to put them in the formula:
>$$<a,b>+<c,d> = <a+c,b+d>$$
>And then solve.

>A __unit vector__ is a vector that has a magnitude of 1.
>
>Two important vectors are defined as follows:
>	$\vec{i}= <1,0>$ and $\vec{j}= <0,1>$
>
>With $\vec{i}$ and $\vec{j}$ we can express any vector of <a,b> in the form $a\vec{i}+b\vec{j}$.

>[!info] Dot Product
>The __dot product__ of two vectors $\vec{u}= <a,b>$ and $\vec{u}= <c,d>$ is denoted $\vec{u}*\vec{v}$, which is read as u dot v and is calculated as $\vec{u}*\vec{v}=ac+bd$.
>
>The result is a _number_ __NOT__ a vector. It is sometimes called the __inner product__. A dot product is needed to find angles between vectors solve physics problems and derive geometric theorems.

>$(4)(2)+(-1)(5)$ Plug in
>$8-5$ Solve
>$3$

>Don't overthink these ones, they really are this simple.

>[!info] Properties of __Dot-Product__
>$\vec{u}*\vec{v}=\vec{v}*\vec{u}$
>$(\vec{u}+\vec{v})*\vec{w}=\vec{u}*\vec{w}+\vec{v}*\vec{w}$
>$\vec{o}*\vec{u}=\vec{o}$
>$\vec{u}*\vec{u}=|\vec{u}|^2$
>
>Know for $\vec{u}= <a,b>$
>$|\vec{u}|=\sqrt{ a^2+b^2 }$
>$\vec{u}*\vec{u}= <a,b>*<a,b>$
>$=a^2+b^2$

>[!note] Geometric interpretation of the dot-product
>If $\theta$ is the angle between two non-zero vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$, where $0\leq \theta\leq 180\degree$, then:
>$$\cos \theta=\frac{\vec{u}*\vec{v}}{|\vec{u}| |\vec{v}|}$$

>[!faq]- Find the angle between <3,6> and <9,3>
>Know the prior formula.
>
>Find: $u*v=3(9)+6(3)$
>$=45$
>
>$|\vec{u}|=\sqrt{ 3^2+6^2 }=\sqrt{ 45 }$
>
>$|\vec{v}|=\sqrt{ 9^2+3^2 }=\sqrt{ 90 }$
>
>Now solve in your calculator: $\frac{45}{\sqrt{ 45*90 }}$
>$.707107$ Find the inverse
>
>$=45\degree$

>[!note] Zero dot-product
>If the dot product of two vectors is 0, the $\cos \theta=0$, therefore $\theta=90\degree$ which means the vectors are perpendicular to one another.
>
>For vectors, the term for having an angle of $90\degree$ is called __orthogonal__.
