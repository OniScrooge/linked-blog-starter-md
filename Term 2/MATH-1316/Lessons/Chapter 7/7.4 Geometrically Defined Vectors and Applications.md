A vector quantity can be represented as a directed line segment called a __vector__.

>The length of the vector represents the magnitude of the vector quantity and the arrowhead represents the direction

>[!faq]- A force of 20lb applied at an angle of 45 degrees above the horizontal _can_ be represented as:

>[!faq]- Given: ![[Drawing 2024-04-23 14.47.42.excalidraw]]
>This vector can be written as $\vec{AB}$ or $\vec{U}$
>
>Vectors can also be represented as bold type without the arrows

>[!note] Order
>Order __matters__ when listing as endpoints. Point 1st, then arrowhead.

>[!faq]- Given: ![[Drawing 2024-04-23 14.50.58.excalidraw]]
>Vector $\vec{DC}$
>
>$\vec{AB}$ and $\vec{DC}$ have the same magnitude(same length) and opposite direction

>[!note] Notation
>The magnitude of $\vec{AB}$ is written $|\vec{AB}|$
>
>Two vectors are equal if and __only__ if they have the same direction and the same magnitude(__location does not matter!__)

>[!info] Summing vectors
>The sum of two vectors is also a vector.
>
>There are two ways to find the sum of $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ geometrically.
> >1.) Place the initial point of vector $\vec{B}$ at the terminal point of vector $\vec{A}$.[[Drawing 2024-04-23 14.57.45.excalidraw]]
> >The vector with the same initial point as $\vec{A}$ and terminal point as $\vec{B}$ is the sum $\vec{A+B}$
>
> >2.) The _parallelogram rule_ says to place vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ so that their initial points coincide.[[Drawing 2024-04-23 15.01.01.excalidraw]]
> >Then complete a parallelogram with $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ as two of the sides. Then the doagonal of the parallelogram starting from the initial points is $\vec{A+B}$
> 
> $\vec{A+B}$ is called the __resultant__ of vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$. Vector addition is commutative $\vec{A+B}=\vec{B+A}$
> 
> Every vector $\vec{V}$ has a vector $-\vec{V}$ that has the same magnitude as $\vec{V}$ but the opposite direction.
> $-\vec{V}$ is called the opposite of $\vec{V}$
> 
> The sum of $\vec{V}$ and $-\vec{V}$ has a magnitude of $0$ and is called the __zero vector__.
> $A-B$ can be represented as $A+(-B)$.
> 
> The product of a real number(scalar) __k__ and a vector $\vec{V}$ is the vector $k\vec{V}$ that has the same direction as $\vec{V}$ if $k>0$ and opposite direction if $k<0$

>[!info] Geometric properties of Parallelograms
>1. A parallelogram is a quadrilateral whose opposite sides are parallel.
>2. Opposite sides and opposite angles are equal.
>3. Adjacent angles are supplementary(add to $180\degree$)
>4. The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect one another, but not necessarily the angles of the parallelogram.

>[!faq]- Two forces act on a point on a plane. The angle between the forces is $75\degree$. One force is 253 newton and the other is 213 newtons. What is magnitude of the resultant force?
>Note that location does not matter. Just the relationship.
>
>Draw your setup
>Complete the parallelogram
>Draw diagonal from initial setup
>Solve
> >Find the supplementary angle
> >Use Law of Cosines

>Resultant: $|\vec{d}|=370.5$ Newtons

>[!note] Equilibriant
>Sometimes you need to find a vector that will counterbalance the resultant. The opposite vector of the resultant is called the __equilibriant__. The equilibriant of a vector $\vec{U}$ is the vector of $-\vec{U}$. It's basically the opposite pull/weight.

>[!faq]- A 81 ton monolith is transported on a causeway that is 4500ft long and has a slope of $5.1\degree$. How much force parallel to the incline would be required to hold the monolith on this causeway?
>![[Pasted image 20240425142008.png]]
>$$\sin(5.1)=\frac{|AC|}{81}$$
>Solve for __AC__
>$|AC|=81\sin(5.1)$
>$|AC|\approx 7.2$
