>[!info] Graphically
>A complex number can be represented by a vector starting at the origin and terminating at the point with the real part(angle) on the horizontal axis and the imaginary part o the vertical axis.
>
>The absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number represents the length(magnitude) of the vector in the complex plane.

>[!faq]- Graph: $2+3i$

>Keep it simple

>[!faq]- $(2+4i)+(-3+2i)$
>$-1+6i$
>
>You may be asked to graph. Just remember to keep it simple.

>[!note] Trigonometric form
>The form of a complex number is $r(\cos \theta+i\sin \theta)$
>
>Because $x+yi$ could be written as $r\cos \theta+r\sin \theta i$
>
>Sometimes there is a shorthand that we can use instead. $\cos \theta+i\sin \theta$ is abbreviated as $cis\theta$ which just means the form from earlier.
>
>So $r(\cos \theta+i\sin \theta)$ could be written as $r cis\theta$

>[!faq]- Convert to rectangular form: $4(\cos(60)+i\sin(60))$
>Sub in the values of cos & sin
>$4\left( \frac{1}{2}+i\frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2} \right)$
>and distribute
>$2+2i\sqrt{ 3 }$

>[!faq]- Convert to polar form: $3-3i\sqrt{ 3 }$
>All this means is for you to write in the form $r(\cos \theta+i\sin \theta)$
>
>Easiest way is to sketch a graph and plug them into the real and imaginary parts.
>
>Then, you can use this graph to find __r__, because that tells you the length of your legs and in which direction.
>
>$r=\sqrt{ 3^2+(-3\sqrt{ 3 })^2 }$
>$=\sqrt{ 36 }$
>$=6$
>
>Then just find the angle:
>$\tan \theta=\frac{-3\sqrt{ 3 }}{3}$
>$=-\sqrt{ 3 }$
>
>$\theta=-60\degree$ which has to be positive so find the __coterminal__
>
>$360\degree-60\degree=300\degree$
>
And then just put it in the form and you're good.
