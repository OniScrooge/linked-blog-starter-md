>[!info] Polar Coordinate System
>The polar coordinate system is based on a point, called the __pole__, and a ray called, the __polar axis__.
>
>The polar axis is usually drawn in the direction of the positive x-axis.
>
>![[Drawing 2024-05-02 14.51.07.excalidraw]]
>
>When putting the polar system on top of a rectangular system, the pole is usually at the origin and the polar axis is on the positive x-axis.
>
>![[Drawing 2024-05-02 14.53.18.excalidraw]]
>
>/r/ = Distance from the pole
>
>If r>0, then __P__ lies on the terminal side of $\theta$.
>If r<0, then __P__ lies on the ray pointing in the opposite direction of the terminal side of $\theta$, a distance of /r/ from the pole.

>[!note] Rectangular and Polar coordinates
>If a point has rectangular coordinates (x,y) and polar coordinates (r,$\theta$) then the coordinates are related as follows:
>
>$x=r\cos \theta$
>$y=r\sin \theta$
>$x^2+y^2=r^2$
>$\tan \theta=\frac{y}{x}$ if $x\neq 0$

>[!faq]- Plot $(2,30\degree)=(r,\theta)$

>If this had been a -2 then it would keep the same angle, but just extend backwards into quadrant 3.

>[!note] Uncertain Angles
>If you are not certain, you can always convert to Rectangular Form
>$$(r\cos \theta,r\sin \theta)$$
>This is a good way to check if you are in the right spot.

>[!info] Given Points
>A given point on a plane only has one pair of rectangular coordinates.
>
>The same point on a plane has an infinite number of polar coordinates.
>
>Ex.) $(2,30\degree)$
>This would give you all of it's Coterminals as well:
>$(2,390\degree)$
>$(2,-330\degree)$
>
>You can also do the same with a negative __r__
>$(-2,210\degree)$ +$180\degree$ angle with negative __r__

>[!faq]- Find the same point with -5: $(5,120\degree)$
>$(-5,300\degree)$ <-$120\degree+180\degree$ 

>[!faq]- Find two pairs of polar coordinates with rectangular coordinates of: $\left( -\frac{3\sqrt{ 3 }}{2},\frac{3}{2} \right)$
>You have (x,y) and you need $(r,\theta)$
>
>Find the r:
>$r^2=\left( -\frac{3\sqrt{ 3 }}{2} \right)^2+\left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^2$
>$r=3$
>
>Find your $\theta$
>$\tan \theta=\frac{\frac{3}{2}}{-\frac{3\sqrt{ 3 }}{2}}$
>$\theta=-30\degree$ But you need to adjust because that's in Quadrant 4 and your initial point is in Quadrant 2
>$-30+180$
>$\approx150\degree$ 
>
>$(3,150\degree)$ & $(-3,330\degree)$
