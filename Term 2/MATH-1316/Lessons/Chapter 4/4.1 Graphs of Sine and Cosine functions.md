>[!info] Sine and Cosine functions
>They repeat their values in a regular pattern, because of this we call them _periodic functions_.
>
>Sine and cosine repeat values with each revolution of the unit circle, which has a circumference of $2\pi$. This makes the period of sine and cosine $2\pi$.
>
>Periodic function is a function __f__ such that $f(x)=f(x+np)$ for every real number x in the domain of __f__, every integer __n__, and some real number __p__. The least possible value of __p__ is the _period_ of the function.
>
>Period meaning, where the function repeats.

| As s goes from:            | sin of s | cos of s |
| -------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0 to $\frac{\pi}{2}$       | 0 to 1   | 1 to 0   |
| $\frac{\pi}{2}$ to $\pi$   | 1 to 0   | 0 to -1  |
| $\pi$ to $\frac{3\pi}{2}$  | 0 to -1  | -1 to 0  |
| $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ to $2\pi$ | -1 to 0  | 0 to 1   |

_The end of this sine wave being it's period_

Domain: $(-\infty,\infty)$
Range: (-1,1)

>[!note] X-intercepts
>They are of the formula $n\pi$ where n is any integer. They are symmetric with respect to the origin, which means it is an odd function, which that means $\sin(-x)=-\sin x$.

![[Cosine-Function-1.png]]
_The end of this cosine wave being at 1 above $2\pi$_

Domain: $(-\infty,\infty)$
Range: (-1,1)

>[!note] Cosine X-intercepts
>They are of the form $(2n+1)\frac{\pi}{2}$ where __n__ is an integer, its period is $2\pi$. They are symmetric with respect to the y-axis which means it is an even function, which means $\cos(-x)=\cos(x)$

>[!note] Formula
>The formula for understanding any wave function can be represented by:
>$$A<function>(Bx\pm C)+D$$
>|A| is representative of the _amplitude_
>|B| is representative of the _period_, before division
>|C| is representative of the _phase shift_
>|D| is representative of the constant _vertical shift_.

>[!info] [[Amplitude]]
>The _amplitude_ of a periodic function is half the distance from the minimum and maximum values (or distance from the center line to a minimum or maximum value).
>![[Amplitude-period.png]]
>__When asked for Amplitude, always answer in positive, even when it's negative__

>[!note] [[Amplitude]]
>The graph of $y=a\sin x$ or $y=a\cos x$ $(a\neq 0)$ will have the same shape as $y=\sin x$ or $y=\cos x$, respectively, except with range (-|a|, |a|). The amplitude is |a|.

>[!faq]- Graph $2\sin x$. What is the amplitude?
>![[sine-2sinx.png]]
>
>The amplitude is 2

>[!info] Period
>For b > 0, the graphs of $y=\sin bx$ and $y=\cos bx$ will resemble that of $y=\sin x$ and $y=\cos x$, respectively but with a period of $\frac{2\pi}{b}$.

>[!faq]- Sketch $y=\sin3x$ with a period of $\frac{2\pi}{3}$
>To graph this, multiply period by $\frac{1}{4}$ to get the width of the intervals needed to graph one period, because it starts at 0 and goes through 4 points, hence the $\frac{1}{4}$
>
>Width of intervals = $\frac{2\pi}{3}*\frac{1}{4}=\frac{\pi}{6}$ wide
>
>From the left ide of graph, add this width 4 times labeling at each addition with the width calculated previously.
>
>Now, use the pattern from basic graph to put your points.

>[!note] Vertical reflection
>$y=-\sin x$ and $y=-\cos x$ are the graphs of $y=\sin x$ and $y=\cos x$ respectively, reflected across the x-axis.

>[!faq]- Graph $y=-\cos x$
>![[vertical-reflections.png]]

>[!info] Frequency
>The number of cycles(periods) completed in one second.

>[!faq]- For an electrical circuit, the voltage __E__ is modeled by $E=3.8\cos40\pi t$ where __t__ is measured in seconds. a) Find the amplitude and period. b) Find the frequency. c) Find __E__ when t=.02
>a)
>	Amplitude = 3.8
>	Period = $\frac{2\pi}{40\pi}=\frac{1}{20}$
>
>	This means it completes one period in $\frac{1}{20}th$ of a second.
>b)
>	If you have one second, and it completes a period in $\frac{1}{20}th$ of a second, that means the frequency is: 20 periods
>c)
>	E = $3.8\cos(40\pi(.02))=-3.074$
