>[!note] Using your calculator
>Make sure your calculator is set for degrees, not radians upon starting it every time or else you will get the number wrong on the test.

>[!faq]- Approximate this: $\tan 68\degree 43'$
>$\tan\left( 68+\frac{43}{60} \right)$
>
>Place this in the calculator and you get **2.567**

>[!note] Using your calculator
>In the TI Calculator you can find degree and minute by pressing the **2nd** button and then the **angle** button. Seconds is the **alpha** function on **+** or at least it should be.

$csc 35.8471 = \frac{1}{\sin 35.8471\degree}=1.7076$

$\sec-287\degree=\frac{1}{\cos-287}=3.4203$

>[!info] Negative degrees
>When the degrees is given with minutes the formula in your calculator , $\sin(287'30)$ for example, will be $\sin\left( 210+\frac{30}{60} \right)$. When it is a negative, for example $\sin(-287'30)$, it will instead be $\sin\left( 210-\frac{30}{60} \right)$. Note the change from adding to subtracting.

Use these on your calculator to ensure it is configured correctly.

If you have $\sin \theta=x$ you can solver for $\theta$ by using:
$$\sin^{ -1 }x=\theta$$Which is read as: *Inverse* *sine* of *x* is *theta*

$\sin^{1}x, \cos^{1}x, \tan^{1}x$ find the angles for the function value x. They are the **2nd** function of sin, cos, tan on most calculators.

>[!faq]- Find an angle on $[0\degree,90\degree]$ that satisfies.
>
>$\cos \theta=.9211854056$
>
>$\theta=\cos^{1}(.9211854056)$
>
>$\theta=22.9$

>[!note] Changing trigonometric functions
>Cotangent, secant and, cosecant change to tangent, cosine, and sine respectively before doing an inverse to find $\theta$.
>	$\csc=\frac{1}{\sin}$
>	$\sec=\frac{1}{\cos}$
>	$\cot=\frac{1}{\tan}$

>[!faq]- Any offset between a stationary radar gun and a moving target creates a **cosine effect** that reduces the radar mileage reading by the cosine of the angle between the gun and the vehicle. This means the radar speed meaning is the product of the actual reading and the cosine of the angle. Find the radar readings to the nearest hundreth for *autoA* and *autoB*.
>
>To summarize: radar reading = actual speed + $\cos \theta$ 
>
>So if it was traveling at 70mph at a $10\degree$ to you, just plug and chug it in your calculator as: reading reading = $70 * \cos10\degree$
>
>And if it was 70mph at a $20\degree$, then just plug it in the same way in the calculator.
>
>Simple, right?
