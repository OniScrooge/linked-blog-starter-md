>[!info] Exact Number
>An exact number is a number resulting from counting or theoretical work. It is **NOT** a result of measurement, as physical measurement is only an approximate and not perfect.

>[!info] Significant digits
>Are digits obtained by measurement.
>
>Ex.) 16 has 2 significant digits
>16.38 has 4 significant digits
>408 has 3 significant digits
>480 has 2 significant digits
>.0025 has 2 significant digits
>.00250 has 3 significant digits
>
>The number of significant digits depends on the digits in the number that are in question to their value. Note .00250, that extra 0 on the end means there could be another digit after it and is therefore counted, so this number has 3. However, they don't count for a number like 480 which has only 2. _Count 0s when they are in the middle especially._

>[!note] Measured Numbers
>When performing calculations with measured numbers(significant digits), identify the number with the least amount of significant digits _sig. digs._ and round to that number of significant digits. Your answer is only as accurate as the _least accurate_ number in a calculation.

>[!faq]- Solve right triangle ABC, if __B__ = $28\degree 40'$ and __a__ = $25.3cm$. Use sig. digs.
>To solve a triangle means to find _all_ missing _sides_ and _angles_ of the triangle. A standard triangle is labeled so that __angle A__ is opposite __side a__, __angle B__ is opposite __side b__, and __angle C__ is opposite __side c__. __Angle C__ will be the right angle if none exists, where **A** and **B** can be on either side of **C**.
>
>You can find your first angle easy since a right triangle equals 180.
>$A=180\degree-90\degree-28\degree40'$ Which equals $61\degree 20'$
>
>Now that you have all three angles, you can use [[Soh Cah Toa]] to find the sides of the triangle.
>$\tan 28\degree 40'=\frac{b}{25.3}$ to get the side __b__ which is opposite of angle __B__.
>Which is 13.83222... and when you only use it's _sig. digs._ it's just 13.8, because __the angle given to you only has 3.__
>
>You might attempt to use Pythagorean Theorem to find the last side, but this is **not advised unless it is unavoidable**, as using it will result in compounded innacurracies when calculating.
>
>You can use the _Cah_ to find the last side of this triangle.
>$\cos 28\degree 40'=\frac{25.3}{c}$
>Which is 28.8 once you reduce it to its _sig. digs._

>[!info] Solving a right triangle
>If you are given a right triangle and are forced to use Pythagorean Theorem so get all of your sides, you're probably wondering how to use the sides to get your two remaining angles.
>You would use your [[Soh Cah Toa]] but once you have the formula set up, remember to use the **inverse** of the normal function.
>
>Ex.) Opposite = 44.25 and adjacent = 55.87 and you've decided to use the Tan function. It would be $side=\tan^{-1}\left( \frac{44.25}{55.87} \right)$.

>[!note]- Angle of Elevation
>From point __X__ to point __Y__(above __X__), this is the acute angle formed by ray __XY__ and a horizontal ray with endpoint __X__.

>[!note]- Angle of Depression
>From point __X__ to point __Y__(below __X__), this is the acute angle formed by ray __XY__ and a horizontal ray with endpoint __X__.
>![[angle-of-depression.png]]

>[!faq]- The angle of a _depression_ from the top of a tree to a point on the ground 15.5m from the _base_ of the tree is $60.4\degree$. Find the _height_ of the tree:
>
>First, it says depression, so you know which way that it is asking you to draw your triangle.
>
>It has told you the angle of depression $60.4\degree$ and the distance from the base, which means that 15.5m will be your bottom side.
>
>Because this is effectively a right triangle, you know that your angle of depression up top on the _outside_ of this triangle, you know the _inside_ angle at the bottom is the _EXACT SAME_.
>
>From there now that you have the inside angle and one of the sides, you can use [[Soh Cah Toa]] to find the _height_ of the triangle that you need.
>
>Which in this case: $height=27.3m$ Written as such with _sig. digs._
