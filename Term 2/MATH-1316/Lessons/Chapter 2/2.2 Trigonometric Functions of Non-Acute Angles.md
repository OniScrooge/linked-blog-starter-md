Every angle in standard position has an associated positive acute angle called it's *reference angle*. It is found by finding the angle between the terminal side of the angle and the x-axis. The *reference angle* is referred to as $\theta'$ (Theta Prime).

>[!note]
>The reference angle is always with respect to the **X-axis** and **NOT THE Y-AXIS**.

>[!faq]- Find the refence angle for $294\degree$.
>First of all, it's obviously in Quadrant 4, so you need to use the formula for that quadrant $\theta'=360\degree-\theta$.
>
>So do basic math and $360-294$ and that equals out to $66\degree$

>[!faq]- Find the reference angle for $1295\degree$.
>You can't put 1295 on a circle, so just keep subtracting 360 until you get a number you can graph.
>
>Which ends up in quadrant 3, so use the formula for that quadrant which is $180\degree-\theta$.
>
>So just plug it in and solve $180-215$ which means our reference angle is $30\degree$.

>[!note] Reference angles
>Reference angles will not be negative, even if you use a formula such as 180 - 240 you will put a positive angle as your reference angle. Don't make this mistake on the test.

**This is another place where you will use the** [[UnitCircle.png]]. As well as the answer being written with the [[Exact value]] if it is a decimal.

>[!faq]- Find the 6 trig functions for the angle $780\degree$.
Minus 360 twice and you have a plottable angle of $60\degree$ which is $\frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2} , \frac{1}{2}$.
$\sin=\frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2}$ 
$\cos=\frac{1}{2}$
$\tan=\sqrt{ 3 }$
$\csc=\frac{2\sqrt{ 3 }}{3}$
$\sec=2$
$\cot= \frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{3}$

>[!faq]- Evaluate: $\sin^245\degree+3\cos^2135\degree-2\tan225\degree$
>First, rewrite $$(\sin45\degree)^2+3(\cos135\degree)^2-2(\tan225\degree)$$
>
>Second, solve the trigonometric functions: $$\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }} \right)^{2}+3\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{2}-2(1)$$
>
>Then just solve that which *evaluates* to 0.

>[!faq]- Find all values of $\theta$ if $\theta$ is in the interval $[0,360\degree)$ and $\sin \theta=-\frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2}=\frac{y}{r}$.
>
>First, this tells you that $y=-\sqrt{ 3 }$ and that $r=2$
>
>This means that my angle is below the x-axis and either one of the following can happen with a reference angle of $60\degree$.
>
>So, the $\theta$ is $=360-60, 180+160$ which allows you to finally find the values of $300\degree, 240\degree$.

>[!faq]- Find the coordinates(x, y) of the point P if it is located at $210\degree$ on a standard position triangle that is 12 radius.
>Start off by remembering that **x** and **y** are just $\cos \frac{x}{r}$ & $\sin \frac{y}{r}$ respectively.
>So find the values of the **radius**, **x**, and **y**.
>Radius is given to us: 12. So that's easy peasy
>The reference angle is $30\degree$ in Quadrant 3
>So the $\cos210\degree=-\frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2}$
>And the $\sin210\degree=-\frac{1}{2}$
>Substitute these values into the formulas above, starting with $\cos \frac{x}{r}$:
>
>$-\frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2}=\frac{x}{12}$ Substitute
>$-\frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2}*12=x$ Multiply by 12
>$-6\sqrt{ 3 }=x$ Simplify
>
>Now do the same with $\sin \frac{y}{r}$:
>
>$-\frac{1}{2}=\frac{y}{12}$ Substitute
>$-\frac{1}{2}*12=y$ Multiply by 12
>$-6=y$ Simplify
>
>So, the coordinates for **P** are: $(-6\sqrt{ 3 }, -6)$
