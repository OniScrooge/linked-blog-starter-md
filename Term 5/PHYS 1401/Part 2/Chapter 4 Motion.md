- These laws don't work in the extremes. _IE Quantum_
- Contact forces:
	- Tension of springs
	- Pulling carts
	- Electro static forces
	- Magnets
- Four forces of nature: _In order of strength_
	- Strong Nuclear - Between atoms
	- Electromagnetic
	- Weak Nuclear - Radioactive decay
	- Gravity
- Laws of motion:
	- 1st - An object moves with constant velocity unless a net force acts upon it.
	- 2nd - The acceleration of an object is proportional to the net force.
	- 3rd - For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
- External forces vs Internal forces
	- External forces of a car is the force applied by the engine
	- Internal forces of a car would be what you apply to the pedal, and don't apply
- __Inertia__ - The tendency of an object to continue in its original motion.
	- If you hit a golf ball, then hit a bowling ball with the same force, the golf ball will travel further, both resist changes in their motion but differs cause of mass. The more _mass_, the more _resistance_
- 1st law
	- $\vec{F}_{NET}=\sum\vec{F}_{NET}$
- 2nd law
	- $\vec{a}=\frac{\sum{\vec{F}}}{m}$ or $\sum\vec{F}=\vec{a}*m$
	- If you double the force, the acceleration doubles
- 3rd law
	- $\vec{F}_{12}=-\vec{F}_{21}$
	- The 12 means force of 1 on 2
- Units of force:
	- $1N=\frac{1kg*m}{s^2}$
	- 1N=0.225lb
- An object can move without external forces?
	- True, movement can be the initial before a force is applied.
- If a single force acts on an object, the object accelerates?
	- True
- If an object accelerates at least one force is acting on it?
	- True
- If an object isn't accelerating, no external force is acting on it?
	- False
- If the net force acting on an object is in the positive x direction, the object moves only in the positive x direction?
	- False
- Universal Gravitation
	- $F_{g}=G\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^2}$
	- G = constant gravity $=6.67\times10^{-11}$
- Weight and mass ain't the same. _Weight_ is dependent on _mass_
- 1N of gold, does it have more mass on the Moon or Earth?
	- The Moon
- If two identical planets, each with surface gravity _g_ and volume _V_, coalesce into one planet with volume _2V_, the surface gravity of the new planet is 2g. _(True/False)_
	- False
- Mass is inherent, no matter where it is, it's weight that changes.
- Car hits a truck, which one experiences the more force?
	- Neither, the force is the same. Newton's 3rd law
- $\vec{n}$ is the __normal force__
	- The force a table would exert on a TV that is sitting on it
	- $\vec{n}$ is always perpendicular to the surface
