>[!faq]- What's the difference between basic quantities of physics and derived quantities of physics?
>Basic quantities are measurable like length, time, and mass.
>Derived quantities are derived from measurable quantities, like velocity being equal to distance divided by time.

>[!faq]- Dimensional analysis
>$420\frac{km}{hr}=?\frac{m}{s}$
>TODO

>[!faq]- Significant figures
>__Adding/Subtracting__ - Smallest number of decimals
>__Multiplying/Dividing__ - Smallest number of significant digits

>[!faq]- Vectors - Breaking into components and angles
>$\vec{V}_{x}=V\cos \theta$
>$\vec{V}_{y}=V\sin \theta$

>[!faq]- Find the distance between polar coordinates
>$A=(5,30\degree)$
>$B=(10,45\degree)$
>
>$\vec{R}=\vec{B}-\vec{A}$
>
>$A_{x}=A\cos \theta$
>$B_{x}=B\cos \theta$
>
>$A_{y}=A\sin \theta$
>$B_{y}=B\sin \theta$

>[!faq]- Unit vector addition and subtraction
>$A=3i-5i+6k$
>$B=2i+j-2k$
>
>Be able to do:
>- A+B
>- 2A+B
>- 2A-B

>[!faq]- Remember the difference between speed and velocity, distance and displacement
>If you went 5km east, then 5km west, over the course of 10min, what is the __avg speed__, __avg velocity__, __distance__, and __displacement__.
>S=velocity/time=100/6
>dist=10km
>displacement=0
>velocity=distance/time

>[!faq]- Maximum height vs maximum range

>[!faq]- Released from rest, given time and fall, find the height it fell

>[!faq]- If thrown up, given velocity, find time of flight

>[!faq]- Given velocity vectors, _2_ _final_ + _initial_, given _time_, find avg acceleration
>$A_{avg}=\frac{\nabla \vec{V}}{\nabla t}=\frac{\vec{V}_{f}-\vec{V}_{i}}{\nabla t}$
>$V_{avg}=\frac{\nabla\vec{r}}{\nabla t}$
