# Introduction: Interest Groups and Lobbying in Texas

## Introduction: Lobbyists are Important for Democracy

"Say you’re passionate about finding a cure for Parkinson’s disease. You can try to be a lone voice in the wilderness, but chances are there’s a lobbying organization that can bolster your argument with research and facts, and the ability to get that info to people who make the decisions.

Critics like to slam lobbyists as stand-ins for special interests. That’s the funny thing about special interests. They’re easily dismissed as “special,” until they’re yours. Lobbyists represent all points of view on issues confronting the country: environment, labor, the elderly, veterans, but also privacy advocates, pet owners, and even online poker players. That’s the great thing about America.

Everyone has a voice, and lobbyists are an eﬀective way to get those voices heard."

# Interest Groups in Texas

## Introduction

The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the freedom of speech, which we usually think of as the right of an individual to openly express a point of view – even a controversial one. But the amendment goes on to guarantee “…the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.”

The right to assemble and express a collective opinion is really a constitutional right to form interest groups, and to lobby on public policy issues. If the Texas chapter of the [Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/texas) organizes a group to lobby state legislators on climate change issues, they’re exercising their constitutional right to express a collective opinion. If the [Texas Association of Realtors](https://www.texasrealestate.com/) organizes a group to lobby the legislature to repeal a real estate tax they consider unfair, what are they doing? They’re peaceably assembling, and they’re petitioning their state government for a redress of grievances. If the [Texas Barber Association](https://americanbarber.org/career/texas/) lobbies against a sales tax on haircuts, they’re doing the same thing.

## What are Interest Groups?

While the term _interest group_ is not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, the framers were aware that individuals would band together in an attempt to use government in their favor. In _Federalist_ No. 10, James Madison warned of the dangers of “factions,” minorities who would organize around issues they felt strongly about, possibly to the detriment of the majority. But Madison believed limiting these factions was worse than facing the evils they might produce, because such limitations would violate individual freedoms. Instead, the natural way to control factions was to let them flourish and compete against each other. The sheer number of interests in the United States suggests that many have, indeed, flourished. They compete with similar groups for membership, and with opponents for access to decision-makers. Some people suggest there may be  too many interests in the United States. Others argue that some have gained a disproportionate amount of influence over public policy, whereas many others are underrepresented.

Madison’s definition of factions can apply to both interest groups and political parties. But unlike political parties, interest groups do not function primarily to elect candidates under a certain party label or to directly control the operation of the government. Political parties in the United States are generally much broader coalitions that represent a significant proportion of citizens. In the American two-party system, the Democratic and Republican Parties spread relatively wide nets to try to encompass large segments of the population. In contrast, while interest groups may support or oppose political candidates, their goals are usually more issue-specific and narrowly focused on areas like taxes, the environment, and  gun rights or gun control, or their membership is limited to specific professions. They may represent interests ranging from well-known organizations, such as the Sierra Club, IBM, or the American Lung Association, to obscure ones, such as  the Texas-based Romance Writers of America. Thus, with some notable exceptions, specific interest groups have much more limited membership than do political parties.

Definitions abound when it comes to interest groups, which are sometimes referred to as special interests, interest organizations, pressure groups, or just interests. Most definitions specify that **interest group** indicates any formal association of individuals or organizations that attempt to influence government decision-making and/or the making of public policy. Often, this influence is exercised by a lobbyist or a lobbying firm.

Formally, a **lobbyist** is someone who represents the interest organization before government, is usually compensated for doing so, and is required to register with the government in which he or she lobbies, whether state or federal. The lobbyist’s primary goal is usually to influence policy. Most interest organizations engage in lobbying activity to achieve their objectives. As you might expect, the interest hires a lobbyist, employs one internally, or has a member volunteer to lobby on its behalf.

## Why Do We Form Interest Groups?

Political scientists point to three major reasons people form interest groups. The first involves **material** benefits. It’s fair to say Americans probably join the nation’s largest interest group – [AARP](https://www.aarp.org/) (American Association of Retired Persons) – not to stand up for the rights of retired people, but in order to get discounts on insurance, as well as other products and services. For most of its history, the National Rifle Association was more about safety classes and insurance discounts that political advocacy.

The second reason involves **solidary** benefits. There’s something very special about getting together with other people who do what you do for a living.

Whether you’re a police oﬃcer, and apartment manager or a dentist, colleagues can learn from each other, discuss best practices and share stories only another person in their business can truly appreciate.

Finally, there are **purposive** benefits – the satisfaction of working together with others toward a common cause. Members of groups like the Sierra Club or [Mothers Against Drunk Drivers](https://www.madd.org/texas/) are motivated primarily by the satisfaction of working with other like-minded people to support a specific cause.

# Interest Group Typologies

## Introduction: Types of Interest Groups

As of 2019, the Texas Ethics Commission listed 1834 registered lobbyists, many of whom represent multiple clients – some interest groups, some individual companies. What are some of the types of interest groups in Texas?

## Texas Interest Groups

**Trade associations** are groups of companies involved in the same business. The Texas Association of Realtors, the Texas Bankers Association and the Texas Automobile Dealers Association are three prominent examples.

**Professional Associatio**ns are like trade associations, but with individual – rather than company – members. The Texas Nurses Association and the Texas Society of Professional Engineers are two major Texas professional associations. The Texas Nursing Association advocates for safe nursing practices through education and licensure in the Texas Nursing Practice Act.

**Organized labor** is another major interest group type. While union members account for less than 5 percent of wage and salary workers in Texas, unions play a prominent role in the political process. The most prominent umbrella group for labor in Texas is the AFL-CIO, but with increasing competition from SEIU Texas, which specializes in government and service workers.

Historically, **agriculture groups** have played a more prominent role in Texas government than any other type of interest group. As Texas politics become more urban, however, groups like the Texas Farm Bureau and the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, while still important, don’t dominate policy in Texas as much as in the 20th Century.

**Racial, ethnic, and minority groups** from the Texas National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and LULAC to Equality Texas advocate on behalf of specific groups of people based on their racial heritage, sexual orientation, or other types of minority status.

**Religious groups** have a long history of advocacy in Texas. Groups such as the Baptist Christian Life Commission have historically held considerable influence  on abortion, gambling, and alcohol issues, but are involved increasingly on social justice issues like predatory lending and human traﬃcking.

One of the least-known, but most powerful classes of interest groups in Texas, are groups of **local governments**. The Texas Municipal League and the Texas Association of Counties have been increasingly active during state legislative sessions as legislators deal with property tax and local control issues that aﬀect their ability to serve their constituents.

Finally, for every cause about which Texans are passionate, there are **cause groups** representing their interests. From the [National Abortion Rights Action League](https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/) (NARAL) to [Texas Right to Life](https://www.texasrighttolife.com/) on abortion and [Mothers Against Drunk Drivers](https://www.madd.org/) (MADD) on drinking and driving laws to [Bike Texas](https://www.biketexas.org/) which advocates for bicyclists, cause groups lobby for their members’ views on a wide variety of policy issues.

# How Interest Groups Influence Texas Government

## Introduction

Texas interest groups use a wide variety of techniques to attempt to influence public policy, but most fall into two primary areas: electioneering and lobbying.

## Electioneering

**Electioneering** is what groups do to influence who the policymakers will be. While federal law has strict limits on the amount of money that can be raised and contributed in federal races, Texas law permits groups to form political action committees that can receive and donate unlimited amounts of money to state   and local election campaigns (_Note: Home rule cities in Texas can limit contributions to candidates for city positions by ordinance_).

The Texas Association of Realtors PAC raised nearly 2 million dollars during the 2018 election cycle, donating $1.2 million to candidates. Texans for Lawsuit Reform, a group that advocates for civil justice reform, donated $1.3 million, spread over 100 diﬀerent candidates.

PACs in Texas have diﬀerent approaches to political involvement. Many interest groups follow – oﬃcially or unoﬃcially – the **friendly incumbent rule**. They avoid backing challengers to incumbent legislators – even when those challengers might be more in line with their group’s interests.

Why?

Because challengers rarely win, and many groups fear retaliation from a spurned incumbent legislator more than they value the chance – often a long shot – to replace that incumbent with a more supportive candidate.

Whatever an interest group chooses to do in an election, the election is  eventually over, and a winner is sworn into oﬃce whether the group supported or opposed him. That’s when electioneering gives way to lobbying.

## Lobbying

**Lobbying** is simply the process of advocating for your group’s interests. Some groups hire professional lobbyists to represent them in Austin. Others rely solely on volunteers.

**Figure 10.1** Texas’ gun-rights lobby swiftly pushed back after Governor Greg Abbott raised the possibility of tighter firearms laws in response to a gunman killing 22 people and injuring 24 others at an El Paso Walmart on August 3, 2019. A gun-rights rally was held outside the Capitol on August 23 and included members of Open Carry Texas and Gun Owners of America. Rallyists carried signs like the one in the image above.

**Grassroots lobbying** involves getting large numbers of constituents to contact their legislators on behalf of a particular issue. When done well, grassroots lobbying is incredibly eﬀective with legislators, who are strongly motivated to please voters who live in their districts. Less well known but also eﬀective is “grasstops” lobbying, which involves generating smaller  numbers  of  contacts from people of special importance to legislators – possibly including their largest campaign contributors, local party oﬃcials, mayors or school superintendents. Even small numbers of highly influential people can sometimes make a significant impression.

Like lawmakers, many lobbyists are lawyers, and the persons they are trying to influence have the duty of writing laws. That the disciplines of law and lobbying are intertwined could be seen in the case of a Texas lawyer, Kevin Glasheen, who had been seeking compensation for his unfairly imprisoned client. Glasheen's exonerated-prisoner client had trouble paying the legal expenses, which totaled $1,024,166.67. Glasheen then lobbied the Texas state legislature to pass a bill that increased the payout to exonerated prisoners from $50,000 per year to $80,000 per year. It succeeded, making it possible for his newly freed client to pay the lawyer's fees (the lawyer was later sued for his billing in wrongful conviction cases).

 Legislators frankly rely on interest groups for information. The 2019 legislature considered 10,877 individual bills and resolutions. Part-time legislators cannot possibly know how each of those proposed changes in state law might impact various industries and interests unless representatives of those groups tell them.

# Interest Group Regulation in Texas

## Introduction: The Texas Ethics Commission

Texas doesn’t place as many limits on what interest groups can do as some other states, but Texas places a high value on transparency. An interest group in Texas can give an unlimited amount of money to a political campaign but must disclose their contributions to the [**Texas Ethics Commission**](https://www.ethics.state.tx.us/), which makes that information available to the public on its recently redesigned, highly-searchable website.

The Texas Ethics Commission has eight commissioners, appointed by the governor, lieutenant governor and speaker of the house.

## Political Action Committees (PACs)

**Political action committees (PACs)** are formed by designating an oﬃcial treasurer, who must then file contribution and expenditure reports twice a year, with additional reports due prior to any election in which it is involved.

## Lobbying

The Commission defines **lobbying** as “making direct communications with members of the legislative or executive branch of Texas state government to influence legislation or administrative action.” Registration is required for any lobbyist who receives more than $1000 per calendar quarter for lobbying, or who spends “more than $500 in a calendar quarter to benefit a state oﬃcer or employee (or his or her immediate family) when the expenditures are made to communicate to influence legislation or administrative action.”

Registration is $750 per year, with a reduced fee for lobbyists representing non- profit groups. Registered lobbyists file monthly activity reports listing their clients and specific expenditures.

Gifts to oﬃcials are limited to $500 per year, and any gift with a value of more than $50 must be reported. Fines of up to $10,000 and criminal punishments as high as a second-degree felony may be pursued against violators.

Some local governments in Texas can place additional restrictions on interest groups. The City of Houston requires everyone who lobbies their city government to register – defining lobbying as either spending or being paid at least $200 in a calendar quarter or $800 in a calendar year “to influence municipal legislation or administrative action on behalf of the employer by whom the person is compensated or reimbursed.” To register as a lobbyist in the City of Houston costs $291.87 per year and is due along with a registration form within five working days of the lobbyist’s first communication with a city oﬃcial.

After registering, lobbyists in Houston file quarterly reports detailing any spending on communications with city oﬃcials, from the cost of buying breakfast for the mayor to the price of a ticket to take a city council member to a ballgame.

As of October, 2019, there were 130 people registered as lobbyists with the City of Houston.
