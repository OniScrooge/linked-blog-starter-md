The free online ebook is embedded in the modules.

The Modules area contains our course materials.  Click on Learning Module 1 to start reviewing materials.  Click on the first tab and start working your way through the module. When you get to Unit 1, you will need to click on the lessons for the information to read. You just have to keep clicking on the lessons and going back to the main unit page to access the reading information. Our resource/ebook is free, so it does not have all the easy access links that we are used to seeing.

Additionally, the free ebook may not have all the information necessary for this course,  thus I have supplemented the modules with links, which also need to be reviewed.  Please review all information in the modules prior to completing exams.  

**VERY IMPORTANT!!!**  You will need to document/cite your sources, since you will need to use additional sources or outside research to complete the Graded Assignment.  **There is help with citations within the Graded Assignments module.**  Students need to properly format sources used (not just links).  The Graded Assignments are worth 25% of your overall score.

You must fully address all questions on assignments, discussions, quizzes and exams.  **Do not copy any materials on response and submissions in this course.**  

**Deadlines are at** **11:59PM!**  This is noted throughout the course and there are NO late submissions.

This is a very busy introductory week.  We will focus on completing the following:

- **_Start Here Quiz_** and **_Welcome Discussion_** due on **January 15 by 11:59PM**
- **_Learning Quiz 1_** prior to the deadline on **January 16 by 11:59PM**

**Important!** Please make sure that you are aware of all deadlines in this course since there are no make-ups in this course. The deadlines are at 11:59PM.  If you need to work on the course materials at night, please make sure that you work ahead in the evenings prior to the deadlines.

**Example for citing GA#1:**  _You MUST cite/document graded assignments (Exams and Quizzes do not require citations since no external sources should be used during testing)._  On Graded Assignment #1, students have to note the location (Article 1, Section 32) within the Texas Constitution (TC) AND cite/document the sources used (_Texas Constitution and Statutes - Home_. [https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/). Accessed on July 2, 2023.) .  There is help for citations/documentation in the Graded Assignments module.  Zoterobib cites your links for you in the established format that you are used to using (MLA, APA, etc...).

Please read all information in this course carefully and pay close attention to deadlines. **YOU are responsible for submitting materials prior to the course deadlines.** The deadlines are listed in the syllabus and throughout the course.   

Students MUST read the assigned chapters in the textbook/ebook and review the information in the learning modules to be successful in the course. Students have 2 attempts at each exam, in case of problems with technology and other unexpected events.  Each exam lasts 30 minutes, so please make sure that you complete all materials prior to starting the exam. **Do NOT copy any information on exams, quizzes or assignments in this course (even in quotes)!

Please use the Inbox feature in the course to send me messages.  If you post comments/replies or use external email, I usually do not receive these in a timely manner.  All email communication needs to be sent using Inbox. 

**Do not copy any information on submissions in this course.**   _This means do not quote or use direct wording from other sources._  The system will let you know the percentage of your submission that is similar to other submissions.

This class has numerous reminders (homepage, course syllabus, module area required materials, posts in Announcements) to help students with course requirements.  When you submit your materials in the designated areas prior to the deadlines, the system indicates what percentage is similar to other sources.  Thus, my reminders to not copy any materials on submissions in this course. 

If students have more than 50% of the submission flagged after accounting for original questions and citations, then this is noted. As per course information, students should not copy any information on submissions. Students can summarize information in their own words, but not directly copy any information (even in quotations).  

Additionally, students need to cite sources on the graded assignments ONLY.  Do not cite on exams and quizzes since students should not be leaving the testing area once started.  _Students can place the citations at the end of each question or at the bottom of the submission in a works cited, with a clear, full listing of sources used._ 

**Example for citing GA:**  On the Graded Assignment,  students have to cite/document the sources used (_Texas Constitution and Statutes - Home_. [https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/). Accessed on July 2, 2023.).  There is help for citations/documentation in the Graded Assignments module.  Zoterobib cites your links for you.
