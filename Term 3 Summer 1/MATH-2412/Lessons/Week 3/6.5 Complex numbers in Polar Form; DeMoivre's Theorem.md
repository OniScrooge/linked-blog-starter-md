>[!info] Complex Numbers
>The imaginary unit __i__ is defines as:
>$$i=\sqrt{ -1 },i^2=-1$$
>The set of numbers in the form $a+bi$ is called the _set of complex numbers_; __a__ is the real part and __b__ is the imaginary part. If $b=0$, the complex number is a real number. if $b\neq 0$, the complex number is a real number. Complex numbers in the form $bi$ are called _pure imaginary numbers_.

>To multiply complex numbers, multiply as if they are polynomials. After completing the multiplication, replace $i^2$ with -1 and simplify.

## The complex plane
We know that a real number can be represented as a point on a number line. By contrast, a complex number $z=a+bi$ is represented as a point $(a,b)$ in a coordinate plane. The horizontal axis of the horizontal plane is called the __real axis__. The vertical axis is called the __imaginary axis__. The coordinate system is called the __complex plane__. Every complex number corresponds to a point in the complex plane and every point in the complex plane corresponds to a complex number. When we represent a complex number as a point in the complex plane, we say that we are __plotting the complex number__.

### Example 1: Plotting complex numbers

Plot each complex number in the complex plane.
>[!faq]- a. $z=3+4i$ b. $z=-1-2i$ c. $z=-3$ d. $z=-4i$

>__a.__ We plot the complex number $z=3+4i$ the same way we plot $(3,4)$ in the rectangular coordinate system. We move three units to the right on the real axis and four units up parallele to the imaginary axis.
>__b.__ The complex number $z=-1-2i$ corresponds to the point $(-1,-2)$ in the rectangular coordinate system. Plot the complex number by moving one unit to the left on the real axis and two units down on the imaginary axis.
>__c.__ Because $z=-3=-3+0i$, this complex number corresponds to the point $(-3,0)$. We plot -3 by moving 3 units to the left along the real axis.
>__d.__ Because $z=-4i=0-4i$, this number corresponds to the point $(0,-4)$. We plot this point by moving -4 units down along the imaginary axis.

Recall that the absolute value of a real number is the distance from 0 on a number line. The __absolute value of a complex number__ $z=a+bi$, denoted by $\mid z\mid$, is the distance from the origin to the point __z__ in the complex plane.

This illustrates the above, as well as being able to represent $\mid z\mid$ with Pythagorean Theorem.

>[!note] The Absolute Value of a Complex Number
>The __absolute value__ of the complex number $z=a+bi$ is:
>$$\mid z\mid=\mid a+bi\mid=\sqrt{ a^2+b^2 }$$

### Example 2

Determine the absolute value of each of the following complex number:
>[!faq]- a.$z=3+4i$ b.$z=-1-2i$
>__a.__ The absolute value of $z=3+4i$ is found using $a=3$ and $b=4$.
>$$\mid z\mid=\sqrt{ 3^2+4^2 }=\sqrt{ 9+16 }=\sqrt{ 25 }=5$$
>Thus the distance from the origin to the point $z=3+4i$, shown in quadrant 1 of the figure below is __5 units__.
>
>__b.__ The absolute value of $z=-1-2i$ is found using $a=-1$ and $b=-2$.
>$$\mid z\mid=\sqrt{ (-1^2)+(-2^2) }=\sqrt{ 1+4 }=\sqrt{ 5 }$$
>Thus the distance from the origin to the point $z=-1-2i$, shown in quadrant 3 in the figure down below is $\sqrt{ 5 }$ __units__.
