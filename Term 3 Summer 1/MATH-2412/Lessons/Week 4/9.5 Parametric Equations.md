## Plane Curves and Parametric Equations

>[!info] Parametric Equations
>__t__ is on __I__, $x=f(t),y=g(t)$

First: $x=t+2,y=t^2,-2\leq t\leq 2$

| t   | t+2 | $t^2$ | (x,y) |
| --- | --- | ----- | ----- |
| -2  | 0   | 4     | (0,4) |
| -2  | 1   | 1     | (1,1) |
| 0   | 2   | 0     | (2,0) |
| 1   | 3   | 1     | (3,1) |
| 2   | 4   | 4     | (4,4) |

Follow these coordinates on a graph and you see that is is a parabola that opens upward. __Do not go past the points, you are restricted to them__.

>[!faq]- Plot the parametric equation: $x=t-2,y=2t+1,-2\leq t\leq 3$
>The points are plotted below

| t   | t-2 | 2t+1 | (x,y)   |     |
| --- | --- | ---- | ------- | --- |
| -2  | -4  | -3   | (-4,-3) |     |
| -1  | -3  | -1   | (-3,-1) |     |
| 0   | -2  | 1    | (-2,1)  |     |
| 1   | -1  | 3    | (-1,3)  |     |
| 2   | 0   | 5    | (0,5)   |     |
| 3   | 1   | 7    | (1,7)   |     |

>[!tip] This can be done with Trigonometric Equations as well
$x=\cos t,y=\sin t,0\leq t< 2\pi$

| t                | cost | sint | (x,y)  |
| ---------------- | ---- | ---- | ------ |
| 0                | 1    | 0    | (1,0)  |
| $\frac{\pi}{2}$  | 0    | 1    | (0,1)  |
| $\pi$            | -1   | 0    | (-1,0) |
| $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ | 0    | -1   | (0,-1) |

>[!info] When asked to _Eliminate t_
>$$x=t,y=2t$$
>Since $x=t$, you can just go to the second formula and rewrite it
>$$y=2t\to y=2(x)\to y=2x$$
>Which is just a line
