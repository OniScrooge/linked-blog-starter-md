## Definition of a Parabola

In Chapter 2, we studied parabolas, viewing them as graphs of quadratic functions in the form.
$$y=a(x-h)^2+k$$ or $$y=ax^2+bx+c$$

Parabolas can be given a geometric definition that enables us to include graphs that open to the left or to the right, as well as those that open obliquely. The definitions of ellipses and hyperbolas involved two fixed points, the foci. By contrast, the definition of a parabola is based on one point and a line.
