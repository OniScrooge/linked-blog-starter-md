# Summary
- Whichever axis comes second determines the axis the parabola opens to.
- __P__ = $4p=n$ where $n$ comes from $n(x/y \pm k/h)$
- __Latus Rectum__ = __Focus__$+\frac{4(p)}{2}$ perpendicular to the direction it opens

## Definition of a Parabola

In Chapter 2, we studied parabolas, viewing them as graphs of quadratic functions in the form.
$$y=a(x-h)^2+k$$ or $$y=ax^2+bx+c$$

>$4p<0$ Downward
>Vertex: $(h,k)$
>Axis of Symmetry: $x=h$
>Focus: Solve for __p__. Set up $4p=n$ in $n(y+h)$. $(h,k+p),(h,k-p)$ for pos & neg
>Directrix: __p__ units in the opposite direction. Pos:$y=k-p$ Neg:$y=k+p$
>$$(y-k)^2=4p(x-h)$$ Indicates that the opening direction is either right or left.
>$4p>0$ Right
>$4p<0$ Left
>Vertex: $(h,k)$
>Axis of Symmetry: $y=k$
>Focus: Solve for __p__. Set up $4p=n$ in $n(x+k)$ $(h+p,k),(h-p,k)$ for pos & neg

Parabolas can be given a geometric definition that enables us to include graphs that open to the left or to the right, as well as those that open obliquely. The definitions of ellipses and hyperbolas involved two fixed points, the foci. By contrast, the definition of a parabola is based on one point and a line.
