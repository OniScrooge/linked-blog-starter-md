>[!info] Law of Sines fact
>In a $\triangle$, the longest side is opposite the largest angle. The opposite is true, as the shortest side is opposite the smallest angle.

>[!faq]- $A=100\degree,a=12,b=10$
>$\sin B=\frac{10*\sin 100\degree}{12}$
>$\sin B=55\degree$
>
>For triangle 1 $b=55\degree$ and following that $180-55$ for triangle 2 it would be $125\degree$. This cannot be true as angle A is $100\degree$, which is a shared side between the two, and there can only be one obtuse side in a triangle.

>This has only one triangle. Basically, add the angle given and 180-(the angle found).

>$\sin C=180\degree-100\degree-55\degree=25\degree$
>$c=\frac{12*\sin 25\degree}{\sin 100\degree}$
