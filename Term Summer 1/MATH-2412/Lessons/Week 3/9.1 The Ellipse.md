> - A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point, the center. The fixed distance from the circle's center to any point on the circle is the radius.
> - The standard form of the equation of a circle with the center $(h,k)$ and radius __r__ is: $$(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$$
> - The general form of the equation of a circle is: $$x^2+y^2=Dx+Ey+F=0$$
> - We convert the general form of the equation of a circle to standard for by completing the square on __x__ and __y__.

## The Definition of an Ellipse
![[Pasted image 20240621133815.png]]
This figure illustrates how to draw an ellipse. Place pins at two fixed points, each of which is called a _focus_(plural:_foci_). If the ends of a fixed length of a string are fastened to the pins and we draw the string taut with a pencil, the path traced by the pencil will be an __ellipse__.

Notice that the sum of the distances of the pencil point from the _foci_ remains constant because the length of the string is fixed. This procedure for drawing an ellipse illustrates its geometric definition.

>[!note] Definition of an Ellipse
>An __ellipse__ is the set of all points _P_, in a plane the sum of whose distances from two fixed points, $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$, is constant as demonstrated in the figure below. These two fixed points are the _foci_. The midpoint of the segment connecting the foci is the _center_ of the ellipse.

>[!info] Horizontal and Vertical Ellipse
>The figure below illustrates that an ellipse can be elongated in any direction. In this section, we will limit our discussion to ellipses at two points, called the __vertices__(singular: __vertex__). The line segment that joins the vertices is the __major axis__. Notice that the midpoint of the major axis is the center of the ellipse. The line segment whose endpoints are on the ellipse and that is perpendicular to the major axis at the center is called __minor axis__ of the ellipse.

>[!quote] The Distance Formula
>The distance, _d_, between the points $(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2})$ in the rectangular coordinate system is:
>$$d=\sqrt{ (x_{2}-x_{1})^2+(y_{2}-y_{1})^2 }$$
