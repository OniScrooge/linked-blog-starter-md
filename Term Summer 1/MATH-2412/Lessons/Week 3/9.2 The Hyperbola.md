# Summary
- __Foci__ = $c^2=a^2-b^2$ 
- Whichever axis if positive first determines if it's horizontal or vertical
- __Asymptote__ = $y-k=\pm\frac{b}{a}(x-h)$
- Drawn as a box

>[!note] Definition of a Hyperbola
>A __hyperbola__ is the set of points in a plane the difference of whose distances from two fixed points, called _foci_, is constant.

>The figure below illustrates the two branches of a hyperbola. The line through the foci intersects the hyperbola at two points, called the __vertices__. The line segment that joins the vertices is the __transverse axis__. The midpoint of the transverse axis is the _center_ of the hyperbola. Notice that the center lies midway between the vertices, as well as midway between the foci.

## Standard Form of the Equation of a Hyperbola

The rectangular coordinate system enables us to translate a hyperbola's geometric definition into an algebraic equation. The figure below is our starting point for obtaining an equation. We place the _foci_, $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$, on the _x-axis_ at the points $(-c,0)$ and $(c,0)$. Note that the center of this hyperbola is at the origin. We let $(x,y)$ represent the coordinates of any point, _P_, on the hyperbola.

What does the definition of a hyperbola tell us about the point $(x,y)$ in the figure below? For any point $(x,y)$ on the hyperbola, the absolute value of the difference of the distances from the two foci, $\mid d_{2}-d_{1}\mid$, must be constant. We denote this constant by $2a$, just as we did for the ellipse. Thus, the point $(x,y)$ is on the hyperbola if and only if:
$$\mid d_{2}-d_{1}\mid=2a$$
$$\mid \sqrt{ (x+c)^2+(y-0)^2 }-\sqrt{ (x-c)^2+(y-0)^2 }\mid=2a$$
