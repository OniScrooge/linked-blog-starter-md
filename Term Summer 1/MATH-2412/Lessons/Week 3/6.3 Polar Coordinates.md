## Plotting points in the Polar Coordinate System
The foundation of the polar coordinate system is a horizontal ray that extends to the right. The ray is called the __polar axis__. The endpoint of the ray is called the __pole__.

A point __P__ in the polar coordinate system is represented by an ordered pair of numbers $(r,\theta)$

- __r__ is a directed distance from the _pole_ to _P_.(We shall see that _r_ can be positive, negative, or zero.)
- $\theta$ is an angle from the polar axis to the line segment from the _pole_ to _P_. This angle can be measured in degrees or radians. Positive angles are measured counterclockwise from the polar axis. Negative angles are measure clockwise from the polar axis.

We refer to the ordered pair $(r,\theta)$ as the __polar coordinates__ of _P_.

Let's look at a specific example. Suppose that the polar coordinates of a point _P_ are $\left( 3,\frac{\pi}{4} \right)$. Because $\theta$ is positive, we locate this point by drawing $\theta=\frac{\pi}{4}$ counterclockwise from the polar axis. Then we count out a distance of three units along the terminal side of the angle to reach the point _P_.

The sign of _r_ is important in locating $P=(r,\theta)$ in polar coordinates.

>[!note] The sign of __r__ and a point's location in polar coordinates
>The point $P=(r,\theta)$ is located $|r|$ units from the pole. If $r>0$, the point lies on the terminal side of $\theta$. If $r<0$, the point lies along the ray opposite the terminal side of $\theta$. If $r=0$, the point lies at the pole, regardless of the value of $\theta$.

### Example 1
Plot the points with the following polar coordinates.
_A_. $(2,135\degree)$ _B_. $\left( -3,\frac{3\pi}{2} \right)$ _C_. $\left( -1,-\frac{\pi}{4} \right)$

>[!faq]- Solution A
>To plot the point $(r,\theta)=(2,135\degree)$, begin with the $135\degree$ angle. Because $135\degree$ is a positive angle, drawn $\theta=135\degree$ counterclockwise from the polar axis . Now consider $r=2$. Because $r>0$, plot the point by going out __2__ units on the terminal side of $\theta$. The concentric circles in the figure are drawn to help plot the point at the appropriate distance from the pole.

>[!faq]- Solution B
>To plot the point $(r,\theta)=\left( -3,\frac{3\pi}{2} \right)$, begin with the $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ angle. Because $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ is the positive angle, we draw $\theta=\frac{3\pi}{2}$ counterclockwise from the polar axis. Now consider $r=-3$. Because $r<0$, plot the point by going out three units along the ray _opposite_ the terminal side of $\theta$.

>[!faq]- Solution C
>To plot the point $(r,\theta)=\left( -1,\frac{-\pi}{4} \right)$, begin with the $-\frac{\pi}{4}$ angle. Because $-\frac{\pi}{4}$ is a negative angle, draw $\theta=-\frac{\pi}{4}$ clockwise from the polar axis. Now consider $r=-1$. Because $r<0$, plot the point by going out one unit along the ray _opposite_ the terminal side of $\theta$.
