Answer: **Reps think Dems are Lazy, themselves are Hardworking, Dems think Reps are Closeminded, themselves are openminded**

**Political Parties**
Lecture:  Why a plurality electoral system tends to have two political parties (see slide #5); plurality v. proportional representation (scenario given; see notes below slide #5; prepare to do simple math, such as 20% of 10); how Libertarian Jo Jorgensen responded to allegation that her candidacy cost Trump the election in 2020 (see: https://www.rt.com/usa/506654-jorgensen-biden-trump-election/ ); across U.S. history, most important issue 3rd parties forced the major parties to address; how FiveThirtyEight.com characterized Pete Buttigieg’s departure from the Democratic presidential nomination race in Feb. 2020 (see notes below Slide #18); know how the Democratic “establishment” defeated Bernie Sanders in 2020 primaries (and compare that to the Republican “establishment” v. Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020) (short answer) (see notes below Slide #18); that Joe Biden will have minor challengers in the Democratic primaries (2024) is an indication of what; on which recent issue have the Democrats and Republicans switched positions (a current event); why is it unlikely that one of the major parties today will be displaced by a rising 3rd party, like what the Republicans did to the Whigs in the 1850s

Answers: **50% plus one is guaranteed for one of the parties**
**"It's Trump's fault he lost, not mine"**
Democrats defeated Bernie due to Bernies socialist policies being too far left for the general public. Republican opponents of Trump tried to paint him as a fake conservative, but his character appeal gave him a pass on his more liberal positions in the Republican base's mind.

**2024 Presidential Race**
Bill Maher on Why Biden Should Not Run Again (2023) – What Maher cites as his concern(s) about when Biden may perform poorly in the eyes of the public and then potentially lose to Trump

Because he's geriatric, failed first term, multiple scandals, obviously corrupt

**Polarization**

Biden described them as the greatest threat to America's democracy, by being corralled into the building by state police, taking photos with them, tearing up one door for funsies with said police, them being held without charges for indefinite periods, and being unrelated to the officers' murder of a random bystander

**Essay Question** – Choose 1 of 3 on which to write (10 points)

Explain the issue of polarization.  Republicans and Democrats are divided on a great many issues, including on abortion rights, gun rights, climate change (and oil policies), crime/policing (defunding the police), the Russia-Ukraine War, and in the 2020-22 timeframe, on the response to the coronavirus (as well as what the science says), as well as many others.  In the context of our lecture on polarization and as polarization is addressed in the subsequent lectures, start by defining what polarization is and what are its consequences, i.e., summarize the big picture points made in the lectures and what you know about polarization, and in your body paragraphs, address a couple of the issues on which our culture is polarized (see list above or identify others), and in your conclusion, tell me if you think polarization is good or bad and why.  Write an introduction, two (2) body paragraphs, and a conclusion.  Be sure to do a little research on the issues that you address, so that you can write something substantive, and give examples to illustrate your points. 

--or--

Write about your thoughts on the Biden administration.  Joe Biden is more than 2 1/2 years into his presidency, coming off a much better than expected 2022 midterm election.  In his first 2 1/2 years, Biden has been fairly aggressive in asserting his policies on a wide range of issues, such as on immigration, climate change and energy policy, racial equity, transgender issues, government activism/spending, diplomacy, Afghanistan, the Russia-Ukraine War, and in the 2020-22 timeframe, on the coronavirus, and probably many more.  In his first days in office, he issued 40+ executive orders, actions, and presidential memorandums emphasizing the policy agenda for his presidency, many of which reversed that of the previous Trump administration.   For your essay, do some research on Biden's policy agenda so that you can address specific aspects regarding what he has accomplished or hopes to accomplish and give your opinion about how successful you believe Biden has been.  You can focus on Biden's agenda, but you can also address valence issues, i.e., Joe Biden's personal traits that defines him as a leader.  Write a catchy introduction, three (3) body paragraphs, each addressing a separate issue area, and in the conclusion, tell me if you think the Biden presidency has been a success so far and what do you think about his prospects to win reelection in 2024 (presuming he runs again)?

Biden is a geriatric puppet whom, even with the vast majority of the mainstream press handling him with kids gloves, manages the miracle of doing worse than his predecessor, who was treated as some sort nuke that will go off if not given negative press attention and vilification on a constant basis.

Biden's attempts to entertain the whims and wishes of the climate accord by canceling pipelines in America has lead to terrible results. In America we experienced a shortage of oil, a spike in prices, and now endure the constant draining of the U.S' reserves, which are held for emergency situations. This course of action combined with no intervention on the Nord Stream pipeline as been on of the major reasons behind the Russo-Ukranian war, the other being Biden's character trait of, "Talk big, do little".

The Biden administration's almost complete apathy towards immigration has been on of grossest cases of inaction. This inaction is due not from Biden himself, but as the appointed border Czar Kamala Harris. Not only was the construction halted for no apparent reason, but policies have been permitted to continue in sanctuary states to the negative effect of the country. This was the case for the majority of the current administration, but has since changed with the sudden continuation of the border wall construction. This was completely unexpected to me and I will give credit where due if this action continues as expected.

Finally, Biden's complete mishandling of America's withdrawal from Afghanistan. A plan that was set in motion by President Trump to finally put an end to the war in Afghanistan which started in 2001 and culminated in disaster in 2021. The action taken resulted in multiple American deaths, the loss of billions of dollars of American equipment, and permitting the capture of Kabul reminiscent of the Fall of Saigon.

The Biden administration has been a abject failure in my eyes. If this were a sane world then the calamities written of previously would be grounds for impeachment, let alone a possible second presidential run. I personally think that his policies, past actions, inactions, etc have little to do with prospects of winning the 2024 election and that if the events of 2020 are permitted to occur again, then Biden has a decent shot at victory over any opponent.

Think about what makes a president great, as presented in the lecture.  Historians look for presidents who take big risks to accomplish big achievements.  Some of the traits that help a president exhibit leadership are good timing, the right personality or character, political intelligence, and political experience--or--you could consider the criteria presidential historians use to rank presidents from best to worst.  You can address the current or past presidents.  For instance, do you think that Joe Biden exhibits any of the qualities of a great president?  Do you think that Trump, Obama, or Bush43 (the son) exhibited any of these traits?  Be sure to give rationale/examples to support the arguments you make.  If you address just one president, go into more detail by addressing a separate aspect of that presidency in each of your body paragraphs.  If you write about more than one president, devote each body paragraph to one president.  Write 4 or 5 paragraphs--an introduction, one paragraph on each of the presidents you address or separate topics about the same president, and a conclusion.
