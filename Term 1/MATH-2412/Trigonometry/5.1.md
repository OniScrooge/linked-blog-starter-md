Verifying Trigonometric Identities

[[Reciprocal Identities]] 
[[Pythagorean Identities]]
[[Even & Odd Identities]]
[[Quotient Identities]]

To verify an identity, we will show that one side of an equation will simplify to the other half.
Note: Only work on one side of the equation. **DO NOT move things from one side to another!!!**

[[Verifying Identities Guidelines]]

Ex) $cos(x) csc(x) = cot(x)$
$csc(x) = 1/sin(x)$ Using [[Reciprocals]]
$cos(x) = cos(x)/1$
So the left side now looks like cos(x)/sin(x) or x/y
The right side is cot(x) which you know that is the same as x/y
And you end up with $cos(x) / sin(x) = cot(x)$ showing that they are verified.

**Note: Order doesn't matter when writing the final expression as far as grading.**

Ex) $cosΘ secΘ / cotΘ = tanΘ$
$secΘ = 1/cosΘ$
$cosΘ 1/cosΘ = 1$
$1/cotΘ = tanΘ$
So yes they're proven
