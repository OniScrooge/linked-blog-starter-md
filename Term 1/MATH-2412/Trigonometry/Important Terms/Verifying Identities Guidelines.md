- The Guideline for Verifying Identities:
	- Work on only one side!!! Generally you will start with the more complicated side and simplify to look like the other side.
	- Look to see if you can use the Fundamental Identities.
	- Rewrite everything in terms of SINEs and COSINEs
	- Factor out the [[Greatest Common Factor]]
	- Separate single term quotient into two terms: $$\frac{a+b}c = \frac{a}c + \frac{b}c$$
	- Combine fractional expressions using the [[Least Common Denominator]]
