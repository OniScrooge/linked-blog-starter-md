If  A, B, and C are the measures of the angles of a triangle and a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides opposite of these angles, then you use the following formulas:

$$\frac{a} {sinA} = \frac{b} {sinB} = \frac{c} {sinC}$$

Or the reciprocal

$$\frac{sinA} {a} = \frac{sinB} {b} = \frac{sinC} {c}$$
