**The distance between the repetition of any function** is called the period of the function. For a trigonometric function, the length of one complete cycle is called a period. For any trigonometry graph function, we can take x = 0 as the starting point.

Basic Periods
1. $sin(x) = 2π$
2. $cos(x) = 2π$
3. $tan(x) = π$
4. $cot(x) = π$
5. $csc(x) = 2π$
6. $sec(x) = 2π$

Take the basic period and divide it by the ß in the function.
