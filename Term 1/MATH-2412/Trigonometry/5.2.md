[[Sum & Difference Formulas]]

Ex) Find the exact value of $sin(105°)$:

$sin105 = sin(45 + 60)$

Use [[Sum & Difference Formulas#^2012b8]] -> $sin(45) * cos(60) + cos(45) * sin(60)$

Use the [[UnitCircle.png]] -> $\frac{\sqrt2} 2 (\frac{1} 2) + \frac{\sqrt{2}} 2 (\frac{\sqrt{3}} 2)$

= $\frac{\sqrt{2}} 4 + \frac{\sqrt{6}} 4$

= $\frac{(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{6})} 4$ This is as much as this can be simplified

Ex) Find the exact value of $cos(75°)$:

$cos(30 + 45)$

Use [[Sum & Difference Formulas#^2012b8]]  -> $cos(30) sin(45) + sin(30) cos(45)$

Use [[UnitCircle.png]] -> $\frac{\sqrt{3}}2 \times \frac{\sqrt{2}} 2 - \frac{1} 2 \times \frac{\sqrt{2}} 2$

= $\frac{\sqrt{6}} 4 - \frac{\sqrt{2}} 4$

= $\frac{(\sqrt6-\sqrt2)} 4$ This as much as this can be simplified

Ex) Rewrite and find the exact value for: $$sin \left( \frac{5π} {12} \right) \times cos \left(\fracπ 4 \right) - cos \left(\frac{5π} {12} \right) \times sin \left(\fracπ 4 \right)$$

$$sin(\frac{5π} {12} - \fracπ 4)$$

In your calculator put in $\frac5 {12} - \frac1 4$

= $sin(\fracπ 6)$ Use the [[UnitCircle.png]]. The unit circle at $π/6$ is for SINE(y) is

= $\frac1 2$

Ex) Find the exact value of: $$\frac{tan(10)+tan(35)} {1-tan(10)tan(35)}$$

= $tan(10 + 35)$ It's always about the numerator with TANGENT

= $tan(45)$ Use the [[UnitCircle.png]]

= $$\frac{\frac{\sqrt2} 2} {\frac{\sqrt2} 2}$$ Simplify

= $1$

Ex) Find cos(a+b), sin(a+b), and tan(a+b) if $sin a = 4/5$ with a in Quadrant 1 and $sin b = 7/25$ with b in Quadrant 2:

Note: $sinΘ = \frac{y}r$

Draw a triangle:
*Picture in phone*

Note: When you've plugged in the $sinα, cosα, sinß, cosß$ into both formulas just use your calculator.
Note: In picture the x ended up in Q3 so it must be negative.
Note: The Pythagorean Theorem in the picture isn't part of the normal formula.

$cos(a+b) = \frac{-4}5$
$sin(a+b) = \frac{-3}5$

Note: There are 2 ways to work with TANGENT; 
- Tan = Opposite/Adjacent
- TanB = sinB/cosB
*Maybe make a picture for this*
