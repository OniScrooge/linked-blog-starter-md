Reference pictures on phone for graphing.
For $f(x) = Asinx$ and $f(x) = Acosx$, A is called the amplitude
For $f(x) = A tan x$ and $f(x) = A cot x$

We say A is the stretch/shrink of the graph

A will do the same behavior for all graphs.

Ex.1) $f(x) = 2sinx$ changes (reference picture in phone for the graphing of the change)

Ex.2) $f(x) = -1/2 cos(x)$

[[Amplitude]] $= 1/2$
Reflection[[Reflected]] = Vertical
*Picture of graph is in phone.*

For $f(x) = AsinBx$ and $f(x) = AcosBx$:
A is still the [[Amplitude]] and B gives the new period through 2π/B = (Basic Period)/B

For $f(x) = AtanBx$ and $f(x) = AcotBx$:
A is still stretch/shrink and period is found by π/B = (Basic Period)/B

Graph: $f(x) = sin1/2(x)$
Period: $2π/(1/2) = 2(pi) * 2 = 4π$
So: Period = 4π
*Picture of graph in phone*

Note: To find the intervals within a period, do; (Period)/4 -> 4π/4 -> π
The ending result of Pi is the width of the intervals(points).

$f(x) = cot2x$
Period = π/2
*Picture of graph in phone*

Width of intervals: $π/2 * 1/4 = π/8$

For $f(x) = 2cos3x$
[[Amplitude]] = 2
Period: $2π/3$
*Picture of graph in Phone*

Width of intervals $2π/3 * 1/4 = π/6$

Graph: $f(x) = AsinB(x-c)$ & 
			$f(x) = AcosB(x-c)$ & 
			$f(x) = AtanB(x-c)$ &
			 $f(x) = AcotB(x-c)$
A still means amplitude of stretch/shrink
B still creates the period
C is called the phase shift: if C is positive (you see negative) move C units right
										: if C is negative (you see positive) move C units left

Phase shift will be the first behavior to put on the graph. Move what was the point on the y-axis.
	For SINE, COSINE, COTANGENT: This is the left side of the graph.
	For TANGENT: This is the middle of the graph.

$f(x) = sin(x - π/2)$
Phase shift is to the right, by π/2, because there is a negative  ->  (x - π)
Phase shift = π/2 right
Amplitude = 1
Period = 2π
Width of intervals: 2π/4 -> π/2
Width of intervals = π/2

*See picture in phone for graph*
Note: In width of intervals, always divide the period by 4 as there are 4 parts of every trig function.

$f(x) = 2cos3(x+π/4)$
Amplitude = 2
Period = $2π/3$
Phase shift = $π/4$ left
Width of intervals: $2π/3 * 1/4$ - > $π/6$
*Picture of graph in phone*

$f(x) = 1/2tan(1/3x + π/2)$
Note: Must be rewritten so that the coefficient of x is outside the parenthesis to see the phase shift. So Factor it out.
$y = 1/2 tan 1/3 (x + ?)$
$3 * 1/3 * ? = π/2 * 3$
$y = 1/2 tan 1/3(x + 3π/2)$  -- Now the coefficient is outside the parenthesis

Stretch/shrink = 1/2
Period = $π/(1/3)$ -> $3π$
Phase shift = $3π/2$ left  --  This is TAN, so when graphing this phase shift is the center
Width of intervals = $3π/4$

*See picture for graph*


For:   $f(x) = AsinB(x-c) + D$
		$f(x) = AcosB(x-c) + D$
		$f(x) = AtanB(x-c) + D$
		$f(x) = AcotB(x-c) + D$

A, B, and C still give the same information.
D is the vertical shift:   If D is positive, it moves up
									If D is negative is moves down

$f(x) = 3sin 1/2(x - π/3) + 1$
Amplitude = 3
Period = $2π/(1/2)$ -> 4π
Width of intervals = $4π/4$ -> π
Phase shift = Right, $π/3$
Vertical Shift = Up

Vertical Shift and Phase Shift is the center line of the graph vertically.
Note: Recommended order when graphing:
	First: To do the phase shift and the vertical shift.
	Second: To do the period.
	Third: To do the amplitude.

*Picture in phone for graphing*

$f(x) = -2cos((1/2)x - π/2) - 1$
Factor out that coefficient inside the parenthesis -> 1/2x
$f(x) = -2cos 1/2(x - π) -1$

Amplitude is -2 and because it is negative it gets [[Reflected]] to 2
Amplitude = 2
Period = $2π / (1/2)$ -> 4π
Width of Intervals = π
Phase shift = Right, π
Vertical shift = Down

Note: If there is a reflection in the amplitude, then consider that the Fourth step in order when graphing.

*See picture in phone for graph*

$f(x) = 1/2 Cot (π/2 x - π/6) - 2$
Factor out the coefficient inside the parenthesis -> π/2 x
$f(x) = 1/2 Cot π/2(x - 1/3) + 2$

Str/Shr = 1/2
Period = π / (π/2) -> 2
Width = 1/2
Phase Shift = Right, 1/3
Vertical Shift = Up, 2

Note: Do not cross the vertical [[Asymptote]]
Note: In COTANGENT it has an [[Asymptote.png]]

To graph f(x) = csc x
First: Sketch f(x) = sin x  --  In blue on picture
- Where SINE crosses the center line, create a vertical [[Asymptote]]   --  In red on picture
- The top of the SINE graph will be the bottom of the one U of the COSECANT graph.
- The bottom of the SINE graph gives the top of the other U of the COSECANT graph in one period.

*See picture in phone for graph*

For f(x) = Sec x
First: Sketch f(x) = Cos x  --  In blue on picture
- Do similarly as prior  --  In red on picture
Note: Anywhere is crosses the center line gets you your [[Asymptote ]]

Graph: $y = 4 Sec (pi)(x - 1/2) + 3$
Str/Shr = 4
Period = 2π/π -> 2
Width of Interval = 2/4 -> 1/2
Phase Shift = Right, 1/2
Vertical Shift = Up, 3
Note: Start by sketching COSINE with this info
Note: Anywhere your line(blue) crosses the center line creates an [[Asymptote]]
