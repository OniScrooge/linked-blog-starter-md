[[Product-to-Sum Formulas]]

Ex) Express each as a sum or a difference: $sin5(x) sin2(x) = ?$

Note: Find the formula that matches the given equation

= $1/2 ( cos(5x-2x) - cos(5x + 2x) )$

= $1/2 ( cos3x - cos7x)$ This is as simplified as it can be

Ex) Express each as a sum of a difference: $cos7(x) cos(x) = ?$

= $1/2 ( cos(7x-x) + cos(7x+x) )$

= $1/2 ( cos6x + cos8x )$ This is as simplified as it can be

[[Sum-to-Product Formulas]]

Ex) Express each as a product: $sin7x + sin3x$

= $2sin(7x+3x / 2) * cos(7x-3x / 2)$

= $2sin5x * cos2x$ This is as far as it can be simplified

Ex) Express each as a product: $cos3x - cos2x$

= $-2cos(3x+2x / 2) cos(3x-2x / 2)$

= $-2cos5x/2 cosx/2$ This is as simplified as it can be

Ex) Express each as a product: $sin(75°) - sin(15°)$

= $sin(75°-15° / 2) cos(75°+15° / 2)$

= $2sin30° cos45°$

= $2(1/2)(√2/2)$

= $√2/2$
