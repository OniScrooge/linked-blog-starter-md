[[Oblique Triangle]]

A relationship that exists between the sides and angles of an oblique triangle is the [[Law of Sines]]

Ex) Solve the triangle:

NOTE: This means to find all the unknown sides and angles.

C = 84°
B = ?
A = 64°

a = ?
b = ?
c = 14

Using the [[Law of Triangle Angles]]
So now $B = 32°$

Now use the [[Law of Sines]] with your calculator

$14 / sin84° = a / sin64°$

so $(14)sin(64°) = (a)sin(84°)$

$a ~= 12.7$

NOTE: If at all possible, never use a rounded value in a calculation for a future value.

Use [[Law of Sines]] on the final value

$c/sinC = b/sinB$

$14/sin84° = b/sin32°$

$(14)sin(32°) = (b)sin(84°)$

$b ~= 7.5$

And you're done!
