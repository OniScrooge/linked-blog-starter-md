**Are different methods, or tricks, to help in memorizing information.**

These tend to fall into 4 categories:
1. **Acronyms** - New words created from the first letter of a list or group of words. Example, memorizing the Great Lakes names as H.O.M.E.S _Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, Superior_
2. **Acrostics** - A verse in which certain letters of each word on line form a message. Example, "My Very Excellent Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas" to remember the planets _Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto_
3. **Rhymes & Songs** - "Columbus sailed across the ocean blue, in the year of fourteen hundred and ninety-two" or from Zero Punctuation, "Whom you can remember with this simple Mnemonic, watch you for Vaas or they'll enslave your arse"
4. **Visualization** - You can use visualization to connect a word or concepts with a visual image. The more the image stands out in your mind, the more likely you are to remember the information. Example, remembering George Washington's name by first thinking of someone you already know named George and imagine them washing a ton of dishes.
