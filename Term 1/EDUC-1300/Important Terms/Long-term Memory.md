The capacity to retain and recall information over a long period of time, from hours to even years. This concept can be divided into 3 categories:

- **Procedural memory** - Deals with knowing how to do something, such as solving a mathematical problem or driving a car. You are using your procedural memory when you are riding a bicycle, even if you haven't ridden one for years; or when you cook a meal from memory without reading a recipe.

- **Semantic memory** - Involves facts and meanings without regard to where and when you learned those things. Your semantic memory is used when you remember word meanings or important dates, such as your father's birthday.

- **Episodic memory** - Deals with particular events, their time, and their place. You are using episodic memory when you remember events in your life; a vacation, your first day of school, the moment your child was born.
