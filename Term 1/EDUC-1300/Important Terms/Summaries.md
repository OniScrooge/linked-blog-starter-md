**A condensed form of the information with answered questions related to the topic at hand.**

They can assist in seeing the connection between ideas, but are primarily used for once you understand the basic information and need complex information regarding those basics summed up quickly, without the need to dig through your notes.

How to make a good summarization:
1. **Read the assigned material, class notes, instructor's presentation slides.** Mark main ideas, make explanatory notes or comments about materials in the margins. Try to predict test questions based on your active reading.
2. **Make connections between main points and key supporting ideas.** Reread to identify each main point and the supporting evidence. Create an outline in the process.
3. **Review marked material.** Put those ideas into your own words in an order that makes sense to you.
4. **Write your ideas in a draft.** In the first sentence, state the purpose of your summary. Follow this statement with each main point and its supporting ideas. See how much of the draft you can develop from memory without relying on your notes.
5. **Review your draft.** Read over your draft, adding missing detail and other important bits of info.
6. **Test your memory.** Put your draft away, then try to recite the contents of the summary out loud to yourself, or to a study partner who can let you know whether you've forgotten anything.
7. **Schedule time to review your summary, and double check before tests.** You might want to do this with a partner. Seek feedback from others including your instructor if they are willing.
