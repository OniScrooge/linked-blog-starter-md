**Visual review sheets that show the relationship between ideas and whose patterns provide you with clues to jog your memory.**

Because they are visual, they help many students remember information more easily, particularly language learning students.

To create a mind map, start with a main idea and place it in the center. Then add major categories that branch out from the center. To these, add pieces of related information to form clusters. You can use different shapes, or colors, to show the relationships among the various pieces of info.

This is an example that was created with Total Recall - Mind Map, a mind map application. Others that can be considered are MindMeister and SimpleMind.
