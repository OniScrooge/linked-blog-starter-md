Your desire to make a particular effort to achieve something that's important to you.

Two types of motivation:

1. Intrinsic motivation - Comes from a desire inside yourself to make something happen, and the reward is the feeling inside when you do get it. Ex) A nursing student who helps others.
2. Extrinsic motivation - Comes from the hope of an external reward, or the fear of an undesirable outcome or punishment. Ex) A delivery driver training to be a manager for when they're incapable performing their current job's physical demands.
