# Studying, Understanding, and Remembering
**Summary** - 13 questions to ask yourself that will help you concentrate by shaping your environment. Memory works in two categories, **Long-term Memory**, which has 3 subcategories **Procedural, Semantic, Episodic**, and **Short-term memory**. Avoid **Multitasking** and the **4 Myths of Memory**. Utilize **Mind Maps**, **Review Sheets**, **Flash Cards**, **Summaries**, and **Mnemonics** for improving memory. Go above and beyond when learning to understand the basics, which will build to understanding it's later complexity.
## Making choices and concentrating
- Methods to improve concentration environment:
	- Form study groups or study partners
	- Find places on campus, public library, or elsewhere for quiet study
	- Disconnect from the internet, phone, mobile devices
	- Turn off distracting music and TV
	- Study at least 4-5 days prior to midterms or final exams
	- Do the assigned reading before class
	- Find a seat in class where you can see and hear better
	- Reduce stress through exercise, sleep, or meditation
	- Go over notes and rewrite, or just clean them up
	- Set aside time to read through your notes every week
	- Take a few minutes on the weekend to get organized for the week ahead
	- Separate yourself from people who distract you
	- Balance your work obligations with your study time, consider working less for more time to study even if that means taking home less money

## How memory works
Memory can be separated into two categories:
- [[Short-term memory]]
	- Stores info for 15 - 30 seconds
	- Can hand 5 - 9 chunks of info at a time
	- Info either forgotten or moved into Long-term Memory

- [[Long-term Memory]]
	- Stores info for hours to years
	- 3 categories:
		- Procedural
		- Semantic
		- Episodic

College is all about [[Deep Learning]].

Strategies to stay focused on deep learning:
- Avoid multitasking
	- The people of today are affected by overload more frequently. We are all, yourself included, are bombarded by more information, more complex info, quicker, from widely differing stimuli, and with less breaks.

	- Multitasking is often seen as a necessity, that is improves efficiency and productivity. Research summarized by the American Psychological Association reports that attempting to perform several tasks at once makes it more difficult to do any particular task well. Source "Multitasking: Switching Costs," American Psychological Association, March 20, 2006, www.apa.org/research/action/multitask.aspx

- Avoid the myths about learning:
	- `Some people have bad memories` - Although the memory ability you are born with is different from others, nearly everyone can improve their ability to remember and recall. Improving your concentration will certainly benefit your ability to remember.
	- `Some people have photographic memories` - Some individuals have truly exceptional memories, but these abilities result more from learning strategies, interest, and practice than the natural ability to remember.
	- `Memory benefits from long hours of practice` - Experts believe that practice often improves memory, but they argue that the way you practice is more beneficial than how long you practice. Try out the methods further explained in this chapter.
	- `People only use 10% of their brain power` - No one knows exactly how much of our brain we actually use. That being said, most researchers do believe that we all have far more mental ability than we actively use.

## Improving your memory

To store concepts and ideas in your mind, ask yourself these questions:
- What is the basic idea here?
- Why does this idea make sense? What's the logic behind it?
- How does this idea connect to other ideas in the material or experiences in my life? Zettelkasten system.
- What are some possible arguments against the idea?

Preparing for an exam that covers a large amount of information will require the following:
- Reduce your notes and text pages into manageable study units.
- Review your materials with these questions in mind. Is this one of the key ideas of the chapter? Will I see this on the test?
- Use study tools that are effective to help you remember what you've learned: [[Mind Maps]], [[Review Sheets]], [[Flash Cards]], [[Summaries]], and [[Mnemonics]].

## Studying to understand and remember
- Pay attention and avoid distractions
- Be confident that you can improve your memory
- Overlearn the material
- Make studying a part of your routine
- Check the internet
- Go beyond memorizing words, and focus on understanding and then remembering the big concepts and ideas
- Know that your interest, motivation, and purpose for retaining information can affect how you store and remember information
- Look for connections between what's going on in your life and what's going on in the content of your courses
- Look for connections between your courses
- Get organized
