## Developing Information Literacy and Communication Skills

### Assess your strengths and set goals

Success in your career will depend on your ability to communicate clearly and think critically about information

### Information Literacy

- Computer Literacy - Ability to use electronic tools to conduct searches and to communicate your findings.
- Media Literacy - Ability to think deeply about what you see and read in broadcast, print, and online media.
- Cultural Literacy - Knowing what has gone on and is going on around you.

### Learning to be information literate

- Information literacy involves more than checking links found on a search engine. To be successful user of information:
	- Know how to find the information you need.
	- Learn how to interpret the information you find.
	- Have a purpose for collecting information.

### What is research, and what's not?

- Research is NOT:
	- Copying a paragraph from a book.
	- Putting together bits of information without adding your own comments
- [[Research]] IS:
	- A process of steps used to collect and analyze information to increase understanding of a topic or issue.

### Choosing, Narrowing, and Researching a Topic

- Decide which particular aspects of the subject to pursue, based on your interests.
- Create keywords by barinstorming
- Narrow your search to about twelve focused and highly relevant hits.

### Using the library

- Books and journals
- Electronic databases containing information not available on public Websites.
- Collections of documents, photographs, maps, music, and films.

### Conduct Effective Searches

- Be picky and filter out what is not helpful
- Understand and use Boolean operators
- Use quotation marks or asterisks when looking for an exact phrase.
- Familiarize yourself with the databases your college subscribes to.

### Evaluating Sources

- Always check for:
	- Relevance - Ask if the information is:
		- Introductory
		- Definitional
		- Analytical
		- Comprehensive
		- Current
		- Ask, "What can I conclude from it?"
	- Authority:
		- Information that was created by someone qualified
		- Conclusions are based on solid evidence
		- Make sure you can identify the author
		- Understand whether the project calls for scholarly publications, periodicals, or both.
	- Bias:
		- All materials have an author who has personal beliefs
		- Serious authors have adopted ways to ensure that their opinion doesn't get in the way of accuracy
		- Research consists of considering multiple perspectives, analyzing sources, and creating something new.

[[The Writing Process]]

### Know your audience

**For most college assignments, writing used in e-mails, texts, and tweets is not appropriate**

- Know when to use abbreviations
- Assume your audience is composed of instructors and other serious students

- Avoids [[Plagiarism]]
- If you use somebody else's ideas, even if you paraphrase those ideas, you must give that person credit.
