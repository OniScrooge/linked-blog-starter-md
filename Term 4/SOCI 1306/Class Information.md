# Discussions
Discussion with your classmates is a vital part of learning online. In this course, you will participate in at least one class discussion in each module. Some modules have more than one discussion. These discussions are an imperative portion of the course as they are meant to replicate the discussions that would take place as if we were in a classroom.  

You can find the discussion topics in the modules on the [Modules](https://hccs.instructure.com/courses/266031/modules "Modules") page.  

## Discussion Parameters

Your posts in the discussion area should exhibit:
- Careful thought and logical reasoning and provide evidence for your position. 
- Each post should be at least one well-developed paragraph (approximately 100 words or more).
- Use correct spelling, punctuation, and grammar.
- The discussions must be completed by the due dates specified on the syllabus.

## Replying to Other Students’

Posts & _Rules of Netiquette_

_Please read and reply to the posts of at least two other students for each discussion. Your replies should offer new substantiated ideas or thoughtful questions._

I encourage friendly debate and disagreement, so do not be afraid to speak your mind.  Always be mindful that your opinion is one of many and be respectful and courteous of others. Accepted standards of computer etiquette will be expected in this class. For information about computer etiquette, see the [Core Rules of Netiquette](http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html)
