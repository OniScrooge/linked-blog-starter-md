## Key Point
Hashing is superefficient. It takes O(1) time to search, insert, and delete an element using hashing.

The preceding chapter introduced binary search trees. An element can be found in _O_(log _n_) time in a well-balanced search tree. Is there a more efficient way to search for an element in a container? This chapter introduces a technique called _hashing_. You can use hashing to implement a map or a set to search, insert, and delete an element in _O_(1) time.
