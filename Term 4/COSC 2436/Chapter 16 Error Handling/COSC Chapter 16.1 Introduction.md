_[[Exception]] handling_ enables a program to deal with exceptional situations and continue its normal execution.

An [[exception]] indicates an unusual situation that occurs during a programâ€™s execution. For example, suppose your program uses a vector `v` to store elements. The program accesses an element in the vector using `v[i]`, assuming that the element at the index `i` exists. The exceptional situation occurs when the element at the index `i` does not exist. You should write the code in the program to deal with exceptions. This chapter introduces the concept of [[exception]] handling in C++. You will learn how to throw, catch, and process an [[exception]].
