|1|You are in Module **(GST)**, the first module of this course: **(GST) Getting STarted**. After you complete the first module, proceed to the second module (IDE), then the third module (CH1), and so on...|
|2|Each module contains links for:<br><br>- STUDY MATERIALS (i.e., PPT, Videos, EXample Programs, etc...) <br>- ASSIGNMENTS (i.e., Quizzes, MyLab Assignments, Programs/Project, and/or Discussion)|
|3|You are currently in the **(GST)** module and the first link in this module is **(GST) READ THIS FIRST** (what you are currently viewing). All links in this module will begin with **(GST)**, the module abbreviation. **This first module is special because you must:**<br><br>- **View** all items in this module  <br>    <br>- **Complete** all the assignments in this module, and<br>- **Score** a 100% on the quiz<br><br>**in order for the future modules to be released!  <br>**|
|4|The next item/link in this module is: **(GST) Canvas How-To and Technical Support**|
|5|Click the **Next >** button located at the bottom right of this page to continue to the next item in the module ... OR ... you may also click on **Modules** (the second menu item to the left of this block of text, in the Course Navigation menu).  A screen will appear with all the modules. Go to the **(GST)** module, and choose the next item of the module. Make sure and go through every link in the STUDY MATERIALS area before proceeding to the ASSIGNMENTS area. Once you view all the STUDY MATERIALS, and complete all the ASSIGNMENTS in one module, move on to the next module.|

## Sandbox
If you are having trouble installing the IDE at home, **please get help as soon as possible**. In the meantime, however, you may still practice and write programs using an online Sandbox (free, online compiler or IDE). 

What is an online compiler? It's for those who
- Want to try programming, but don’t have a compiler installed
- Want to try out features your compiler doesn't support
- Want to practice coding while away from their PC

**These are NOT to replace the required IDE for this course**, but it's a way to get some practice when you are away from your regular PC, or while you are in the process of installing your IDE. 

Here are a few of examples. **Choose your favorite** (sometimes some of these sites busy/slow, in those cases you can select another):
- **Onlinegdb:** [https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler)
    - Type your code and click Run (top menu bar)
    - Enter the following code:

```
![include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() :
cout << "Hello, World!\n";
return 0;
}]
```
