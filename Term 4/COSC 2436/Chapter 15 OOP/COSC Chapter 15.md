# Learning Objectives

1. To define a derived class from a base class through inheritance (§15.2).
2. To enable generic programming by passing objects of a derived type to a parameter of a base class type (§15.3).
3. To know how to invoke the base class’s constructors with arguments (§15.4.1).
4. To understand constructor and destructor chaining (§15.4.2).
5. To redefine functions in the derived class (§15.5).
6. To distinguish between redefining and overloading functions (§15.5).
7. To define generic functions using polymorphism (§15.6).
8. To enable dynamic binding using virtual functions (§15.7).
9. To distinguish between redefining and overriding functions (§15.7).
10. To distinguish between static matching and dynamic binding (§15.7).
11. To override virtual functions using the `override` keyword and use the `final` keyword to prevent further overriding (§15.8).
12. To access protected members of a base class from derived classes (§15.9).
13. To define abstract classes with pure virtual functions (§15.10).
14. To cast an object of a base class type to a derived type using the `static_cast` and `dynamic_cast` operators and know the differences between the two operators (§15.11).
