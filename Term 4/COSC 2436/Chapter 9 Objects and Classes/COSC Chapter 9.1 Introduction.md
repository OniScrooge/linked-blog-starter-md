## Key Point
[[Object-oriented programming]] enables you to develop large-scale software effectively.

Having learned the material in earlier chapters, you are able to solve many programming problems using selections, loops, functions, and arrays. However, these features are not sufficient for developing large-scale software systems. This chapter begins the introduction of [[object-oriented programming]], which will enable you to develop large-scale software systems effectively.
