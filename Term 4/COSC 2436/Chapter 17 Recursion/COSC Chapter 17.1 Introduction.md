## Key Point

Recursion is a technique that leads to elegant solutions to problems that are inherently recursive.

Suppose you wish to print all permutations of a string. For example, for a string `abc`, its permutations are `abc`, `acb`, `bac`, `bca`, `cab`, and `cba`. How do you solve this problem? There are several ways to do so. An intuitive and effective solution is to use recursion.

H-trees, depicted in **Figure 17.1**, are used in a very large-scale integration (VLSI) design as a clock distribution network for routing timing signals to all parts of a chip with equal propagation delays. How do you write a program to display H-trees? A good approach is to use recursion.

To use recursion is to program using recursive functions—functions that invoke themselves. Recursion is a useful programming technique. In some cases, it enables you to develop a natural, straightforward, simple solution to an otherwise difficult problem. This chapter introduces the concepts and techniques of recursive programming and illustrates by examples how to “think recursively.”
