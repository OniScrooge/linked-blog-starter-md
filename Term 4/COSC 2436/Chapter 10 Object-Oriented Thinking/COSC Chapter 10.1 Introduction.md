## Key Point
The focus of this chapter is on class design and explores the differences between procedural programming and object-oriented programming.

**​Chapter 9** introduced the important concept of objects and classes. You learned how to define classes, create objects, and use objects. This book’s approach is to teach problem solving and fundamental programming techniques before object-oriented programming. This chapter addresses the transition from procedural to object-oriented programming. Students will see the benefits of object-oriented programming and use it effectively.​

Our focus here is on class design. We will use several examples to illustrate the advantages of the object-oriented approach. The first example is the `string` class provided in the C++ library. The other examples involve designing new classes and using them in applications. We will also introduce some language features supporting these examples.
