## Key Point
A binary search tree is more efficient than a list for search, insertion, and deletion operations.

The preceding chapter gives the implementation for linked lists. The time complexity of search, insertion, and deletion operations in these data structures is O(n). This chapter presents a new data structure called binary search tree, which takes O(logn) average time for search, insertion, and deletion of elements on average.
