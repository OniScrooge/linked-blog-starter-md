## Key Point

Data in a text file can be read by a text editor.

This section demonstrates how to perform simple text input and output.

Every file is placed in a directory in the file system. An [[absolute file name]] contains a file name with its complete path and drive letter. For example, c:\example\scores.txt is the [[absolute file name]] for the file scores.txt on the Windows operating system. Here c:\example is referred to as the directory path for the file. Absolute file names are machine dependent. On UNIX, the [[absolute file name]] may be /home/liang/example/scores.txt, where /home/liang/example is the directory path for the file scores.txt.

A [[relative file name]] is relative to its current working directory. The complete directory path for a [[relative file name]] is omitted. For example, scores.txt is a [[relative file name]]. If its current working directory is c:\example, the [[absolute file name]] would be c:\example\scores.txt.
