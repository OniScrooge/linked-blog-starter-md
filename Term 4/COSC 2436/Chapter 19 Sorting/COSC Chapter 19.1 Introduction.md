## Key Point

Sorting algorithms are good examples to study algorithm design and analysis.

When presidential candidate Barack Obama visited Google in 2007, Google CEO Eric Schmidt asked Obama the most efficient way to sort a million 32-bit integers (**www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4RRi_ntQc8**). Obama answered that the [[bubble sort]] would be the wrong way to go. Was he right? We will examine different sorting algorithms in this chapter and see if he was correct.

Sorting is a classic subject in computer science. There are three reasons to study sorting algorithms:
- First, sorting algorithms illustrate many creative approaches to problem solving, and these approaches can be applied to solve other problems.
- Second, sorting algorithms are good for practicing fundamental programming techniques using selection statements, loops, functions, and arrays.
- Third, sorting algorithms are excellent examples to demonstrate algorithm performance.

The data to be sorted might be integers, doubles, strings, or other items. Data may be sorted in increasing order or decreasing order. For simplicity, this chapter assumes:
1. data to be sorted are integers,
2. data are stored in an array, and
3. data are sorted in ascending order.

There are many algorithms for sorting. You have already learned selection sort. This chapter introduces insertion sort, [[bubble sort]], [[merge sort]], [[quick sort]], [[bucket sort]], radix sort, and [[external sort]].
