## Chapter Summary
1. The worst-case complexity for a _selection sort_, _insertion sort_, _[[bubble sort]]_, and _[[quick sort]]_ is O (n2).
2. The average-case and worst-case complexity for a _[[merge sort]]_ is _O_(_n_ log _n_). The average time for a [[quick sort]] is also _O_(_n_ log _n_).
3. _Heaps_ are a useful data structure for designing efficient algorithms such as sorting. You learned how to define and implement a heap class, and how to insert and delete elements to/from a heap.
4. The time complexity for a _[[heap sort]]_ is _O_(_n_ log _n_).
5. _Bucket sorts_ and _radix sorts_ are specialized sorting algorithms for integer keys. These algorithms sort keys using buckets rather than by comparing keys. They are more efficient than general sorting algorithms.
6. A variation of the [[merge sort]]—called an _[[external sort]]_—can be applied to sort large amounts of data from external files.
