## Key Point

Algorithm design is to develop a mathematical process for solving a problem. Algorithm analysis is to predict the performance of an algorithm.

The preceding chapters introduced procedural programming, object-oriented programming, and recursive programming. This chapter will use a variety of examples to introduce common algorithmic techniques ([[dynamic programming]], [[divide-and-conquer]], and [[backtracking]]) for developing efficient algorithms. Before introducing efficient algorithms, we will address the question on how to measure algorithm efficiency.
