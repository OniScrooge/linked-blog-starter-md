Developed by C. A. R. Hoare (1962), this algorithm selects an element, called the pivot, in the array and divides the array into two parts such that all the elements in the first part are less than or equal to the pivot and all the elements in the second part are greater than the pivot. The algorithm recursively applies the quick sort algorithm to the first part and then to the second part.
