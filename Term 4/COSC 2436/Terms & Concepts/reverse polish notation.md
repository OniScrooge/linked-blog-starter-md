**Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)** is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands. This eliminates the need for parentheses to define operator precedence, as the order of operations is determined by the placement of the operands and operators.

### Key Features:
1. **No Parentheses**: The position of operands and operators dictates the order of operations, making parentheses unnecessary.
2. **Stack-Based Evaluation**: RPN expressions are typically evaluated using a stack.
3. **Postfix Order**: Operators appear _after_ their operands.

### Advantages of RPN:
1. **Simplifies Parsing**: Computers and calculators can evaluate RPN expressions more easily than infix expressions because there's no need to handle parentheses or operator precedence rules.
2. **Efficient for Stacks**: RPN directly translates into stack operations, which are efficient for computation.
3. **Unambiguous**: The order of operations is clear without additional symbols.

### Applications:
- Used in **scientific calculators** (like the HP calculators).
- Popular in **compiler design** and **postfix evaluation algorithms**.
- Found in some **programming languages** (e.g., Forth).

### Infix vs. Postfix vs. Prefix:

|**Notation**|**Example**|**Order**|
|---|---|---|
|Infix|`(3 + 4) * 5`|Operator between operands|
|Prefix|`* + 3 4 5`|Operator before operands|
|Postfix|`3 4 + 5 *`|Operator after operands|



In postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation, RPN), the operations are executed in the order they appear once enough operands are encountered. Let's evaluate the expression step-by-step:

### Expression: `2 4 6 * + 15 - 21 7 / + =`

#### Steps to Evaluate:

1. **`2`**: Push `2` onto the stack.
    
    - Stack: `[2]`
2. **`4`**: Push `4` onto the stack.
    
    - Stack: `[2, 4]`
3. **`6`**: Push `6` onto the stack.
    
    - Stack: `[2, 4, 6]`
4. **`*`**: Multiply the top two operands (`4` and `6`).
    
    - Pop `6` and `4`, compute 4×6=244×6=24, and push `24` onto the stack.
    - Stack: `[2, 24]`
5. **`+`**: Add the top two operands (`2` and `24`).
    
    - Pop `24` and `2`, compute 2+24=262+24=26, and push `26` onto the stack.
    - Stack: `[26]`
6. **`15`**: Push `15` onto the stack.
    
    - Stack: `[26, 15]`
7. **`-`**: Subtract the top two operands (`26` and `15`).
    
    - Pop `15` and `26`, compute 26−15=1126−15=11, and push `11` onto the stack.
    - Stack: `[11]`
8. **`21`**: Push `21` onto the stack.
    
    - Stack: `[11, 21]`
9. **`7`**: Push `7` onto the stack.
    
    - Stack: `[11, 21, 7]`
10. **`/`**: Divide the top two operands (`21` by `7`).
    
    - Pop `7` and `21`, compute 21÷7=321÷7=3, and push `3` onto the stack.
    - Stack: `[11, 3]`
11. **`+`**: Add the top two operands (`11` and `3`).
    
    - Pop `3` and `11`, compute 11+3=1411+3=14, and push `14` onto the stack.
    - Stack: `[14]`
12. **`=`**: This operator typically means "output the result." Therefore, the top of the stack (`14`) is displayed.

### Final Result:

The expression evaluates to **`14`**.
