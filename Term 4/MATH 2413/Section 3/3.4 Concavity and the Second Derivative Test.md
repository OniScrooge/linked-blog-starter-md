# Summary
- __Procedure__:
	1. Find the first derivative.
	2. Find the second derivative.
	3. Solve for _x_ if possible.
		1. You may need to factor.
	4. Plug in values beyond the _x_(s) found into the original function.
		1. If the result is negative, it's concave up.
		2. If the result is positive, it's concave down.
		3. Remember it goes from $-\infty\to \infty$
		4. The _smaller_ of the two numbers is the lower interval limit $(-\infty,0)$
		5. The _larger_ of the two numbers is the upper interval limit $\left( \frac{5}{2},\infty \right)$
		6. Don't forget to check between those values as well.
- __Constants__ - When the second derivative is just a positive constant the graph is concave up, when it's a negative constant the graph is concave down. The opposite side to each doesn't exist.
- __Square roots__ - If the second derivative is a square root $\sqrt{ 1 }$ when solved for _x_, then there are 2 intervals. $\sqrt{ 1 }=\pm 1\to(-\infty,-1),(1,\infty)$

## [[Concavity]]

You have already seen that locating the intervals on which a [[function]] _f_ increases or decreases helps to describe its graph. In this section, you will see how locating the intervals on which _f'_ increases or decreases can be used to determine where the graph of _f_ is _curving upward_ or _curving downward_.

>[!info] Definition of [[Concavity]]
>Let _f_ be differentiable on an open interval _I_. The graph of _f_ is _concave upward_ on _I_ when _f'_ is increasing on the interval and _concave downward_ on _I_ when _f'_ is decreasing on the interval.

The next two statements and Figure 3.23 give a useful graphical interpretation of [[concavity]] (See Appendix A for a proof of these results).

1. Let _f_ be differentiable on an open interval _I_. If the graph of _f_ is concave _upward_ on _I_, then the graph of _f_ lies _above_ all of its tangent lines on _I_. __See Figure 3.23(a)__.
2. Let _f_ be differentiable on an open interval _I_. If the graph of _f_ is concave _downward_ on _I_, then the graph of _f_ lies _below_ all of its tangent lines on _I_. __See Figure 3.23(b).__

To find the open intervals on which the graph of a [[function]] _f_ is concave upward or concave downward, you need to find the intervals on which _f'_ is increasing or decreasing. For instance, the graph:
Original [[Function]]: $$f(x)=\frac{1}{3}x^3-x$$
This is __concave downward__ on the open interval $(-\infty,0)$:
First [[derivative]]: $$f'(x)=x^2-1$$
This is because the first [[derivative]] is decreasing here. __See Figure 3.24__ Similarly, the graph of _f_ is _concave upward_ on the interval $(0,\infty)$ because _f'_ is increasing on $(0,\infty)$.

The next theorem shows how to use the _second_ [[derivative]] of a [[function]] _f_ to determine intervals on which the graph of _f_ is concave upward or concave downward. A proof of this theorem follows directly from Theorem 3.5 and the definition of [[concavity]].

>[!note] Theorem 3.7 - Test for [[Concavity]]
>Let _f_ be a [[function]] whose second [[derivative]] exists on an open interval _I_.
>1. If $f''(x)>0$ for all _x_ in _I_, then the graph of _f_ is concave upward on _I_.
>2. If $f''(x)<0$ for all _x_ in _I_, then the graph of _f_ is concave downward on _I_.
>A proof of this theorem is given in Appendix A.
> >[!note] Remark
> >A third case of Theorem 3.7 could be that if $f''(x)=0$ for all _x_ in _I_, then _f_ is linear. Note, however, that [[concavity]] is not defined for a line. In other words, a straight line is neither concave upward nor concave downward.

To apply Theorem 3.7, locate the _x_-values at which $f''(x)=0$ or $f''(x)$ does not exist. Use these _x_-values to determine test intervals. Finally, test the sign of in each of _f''(x)_ the test intervals.

### Example 1 Determining [[Concavity]]
![[Pasted image 20241009101214.png]]

The [[function]] given in Example 1 is [[continuous]] on the entire real number line. When there are _x_-values at which a [[function]] is not [[continuous]], these values should be used, along with the points at which _f''(x)=0_ or _f''(x)_ does not exist, to form the test intervals.

### Example 2: Determining [[Concavity]]

## Points of Inflection

The graph in Figure 3.25 has two points at which the [[concavity]] changes. If the tangent line to the graph exists at such a point, then that point is a **point of inflection.** Three types of points of inflection are shown in Figure 3.27.
