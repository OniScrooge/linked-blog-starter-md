## Analyzing the Graph of a Function

It would be difficult to overstate the importance of using graphs in mathematics. Descartes’s introduction of analytic geometry contributed significantly to the rapid advances in calculus that began during the mid-seventeenth century. In the words of Lagrange, “As long as algebra and geometry traveled separate paths their advance was slow and their applications limited. But when these two sciences joined company, they drew from each other fresh vitality and thenceforth marched on at a rapid pace toward perfection.”

So far, you have studied several concepts that are useful in analyzing the graph of a function.

| • Domain and range                    | (Section P.3) |
| • Continuity                          | (Section 1.4) |

| • Differentiability                   | (Section 2.1) |
| • Relative extrema                    | (Section 3.1) |
| • Increasing and decreasing functions | (Section 3.3) |
| • Concavity                           | (Section 3.4) |
| • Points of inflection                | (Section 3.4) |
| • Horizontal asymptotes               | (Section 3.5) |
| • Infinite limits at infinity         | (Section 3.5) |

When you are graphing a function, either with or without a graphing utility, remember that normally you cannot show the _entire_ graph. Deciding which part of the graph to show is often crucial. For instance, which of the viewing windows in Figure 3.44 better represents the graph of
$$f(x)=x^3-25x^2+74x-20?$$
By seeing both views, it is clear that the second viewing window gives a more complete representation of the graph. But would a third viewing window reveal other interesting portions of the graph? To answer this, you need to use calculus to interpret the first and second derivatives. To determine a good viewing window for the graph of a function, use the guidelines below.

The vertical axis ranges from negative 10 to 40, in increments of 5.

The parabola then goes down and to the right, crosses the horizontal axis at (3, 0), then goes down and to the right, and exits the bottom of the viewing window.

### Guidelines for Analyzing the Graph of a Function
1. Determine the domain and range of the function.
2. Determine any intercepts, asymptotes, and symmetry of the graph.
3. Locate any -values for which and either are zero or do not exist. Use the results to determine relative extrema and points of inflection.

In the guidelines above, note the importance of _algebra_ (as well as calculus) for solving the equations , , and .

For more information on the use of technology to graph rational functions, see the article “Graphs of Rational Functions for Computer Assisted Calculus” by Stan Byrd and Terry Walters in _The College Mathematics Journal_. To view this article, go to [MathArticles.com](http://MathArticles.com).

Be sure you understand all of the implications of creating a table such as that shown in Example 1. By using calculus, you can be _sure_ that the graph has no relative extrema or points of inflection other than those shown in Figure 3.45.

The vertical axis ranges from negative 8 to 12, in increments of 1. The curve has three parts. The first part of the curve enters the left of the viewing window, goes down and to the right through the point (negative 5, 2), goes down and to the right, crosses the horizontal axis at (negative 3, 0), goes down and to the right through the point (negative 2.5, negative 5), goes down and to the right, and exits the bottom of the viewing window.

The third part of the curve, mirrors the first part, enters the bottom of the viewing window, goes up, and to the right through the point (2.5, negative 5), then goes up and to the right, crosses the horizontal axis at (3, 0), goes up and to the right, and exits the right of the viewing window.

From this view, it appears that the graph of is about the same as the graph of shown in Figure 3.45. The graphs of these two functions, however, differ significantly. Try adjusting the viewing window to see the differences.

![[Pasted image 20241026150742.png]]

Although the graph of the function in Example 2 has no horizontal asymptote, it does have a slant asymptote. The graph of a rational function (having no common factors and whose denominator is of degree or greater) has a **slant asymptote** when the degree of the numerator exceeds the degree of the denominator by exactly . To find the slant asymptote, use long division to rewrite the rational function as the sum of a first-degree polynomial (the slant asymptote) and another rational function.
Write the original function: $$f(x)=\frac{x^2-2x+4}{x-2}$$
Rewrite using long division: $$=x+\frac{4}{x-2}$$

In Figure 3.48, note that the graph of approaches the slant asymptote as approaches or .

![A function is graphed on an x y coordinate plane. The x axis ranges from negative 4 to 6, in increments of 2. The y axis ranges from negative 4 to 8, in increments of 2. The function is labeled f(x) = (x^2 minus 2x + 4)/(x minus 2). A vertical dashed line labeled Vertical asymptote: x = 2, enters the top of the graph, goes down, parallel to the y axis, crosses the x axis at (2, 0), and exits the bottom of the graph. A slant dashed line labeled Slant asymptote: y = x, enters the bottom left of the graph, slopes up and to the right through the point (negative 2, negative 2), crosses the origin, then goes up and to the right through the point (2, 2), and exits the top right of the graph.

The fourth-degree polynomial function in Example 5 has one relative minimum and no relative maxima. In general, a polynomial function of degree can have _at most_ relative extrema and _at most_ points of inflection. Moreover, polynomial functions of even degree must have _at least_ one relative extremum.

Remember from the Leading Coefficient Test described in Section P.3 that the “end behavior” of the graph of a polynomial function is determined by its leading coefficient and its degree. For instance, because the polynomial in Example 5 has a positive leading coefficient, the graph rises to the right. Moreover, because the degree is even, the graph also rises to the left.

### Example 6 A Function Involving Sine and Cosine

Analyze and sketch the graph of
$$f(x)=\frac{\cos x}{1+\sin x}$$
### Solution

Because the function has a period of , you can restrict the analysis of the graph to any interval of length $2\pi$. For convenience, choose $\left[ -\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{3\pi}{2} \right]$.
