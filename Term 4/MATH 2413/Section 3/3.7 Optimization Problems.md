## Applied Minimum and Maximum Problems

One of the most common applications of calculus involves determining minimum and maximum values. Consider how frequently you hear or read terms such as greatest profit, least cost, least time, greatest voltage, optimum size, least size, greatest strength, and greatest distance. Before outlining a general problem-solving strategy for such problems, consider the next example.

### Example 1 Finding Maximum Volume

A manufacturer wants to design an open box having a square base and a surface area of square inches, as shown in Figure 3.53. What dimensions will produce a box with maximum volume?
![[Pasted image 20241026153239.png]]
### Solution

Because the box has a square base, its volume is $V=x^2h$

This equation is called the **primary equation** because it gives a formula for the quantity to be optimized. Because is to be maximized, you want to write as a function of one variable. To do this, note that the surface area of the box is $S=(area of base) + (area of four sides)$
$$108=x^2+4xh$$

Next, solve this equation for _h_ to obtain $h=\frac{108-x^2}{4x}$. Substituting into the primary equation produces
$$V=x^2h$$
$$=x^2\left( \frac{108-x^2}{4x} \right)$$
$$27x-\frac{x^3}{4}$$
Before finding which -value will yield a maximum value of , you should determine the _feasible domain_. That is, what values of make sense in this problem? You know that . You also know that must be nonnegative and that the area of the base is at most . So, the feasible domain is
$$0\leq x\leq \sqrt{ 108 }$$
To maximize , find its critical numbers on the interval $(0,\sqrt{ 108 })$.

So, the critical numbers are . You do not need to consider because it is outside the domain. Evaluating at the critical number and at the endpoints of the domain produces , , and

. So, is maximum when , and the dimensions of the box are inches by inches by inches.

In Example 1, you should realize that there are infinitely many open boxes having square inches of surface area. To begin solving the problem, you might ask yourself which basic shape would seem to yield a maximum volume. Should the box be tall, squat, or nearly cubical?

You might even try calculating a few volumes, as shown in Figure 3.54, to determine whether you can get a better feeling for what the optimum dimensions should be. Remember that you are not ready to begin solving a problem until you have clearly identified what the problem is.

The dimension of the third box is 5 * 5 * 4(3/20). The fourth open box with a square base is labeled Volume = 108. The dimension of the fourth box is 6 * 6 * 3. The dimension of the third box is 5 * 5 * 4(3/20). The fifth open box with a square base is labeled Volume = 88. The dimension of the fifth box is 8 * 8 * 1(3/8). The first box is the tallest and the fifth box is the shortest. The first box is narrow while the fifth box is wider.](https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/mathematics/larson_9780357749135/images/daaw_0001_0001_0_img0468-t2.png?token=960496A52B921DD34BC4366024459047606447605992A56563E710724ABB16CFBA6971AAF45EA302A3E236E01A4BF5AA6711F94936B8330E2FE6ACDEB27393B150DB2714E1B1FA96)

### Guidelines for Solving Applied Minimum and Maximum Problems

1. Identify all _given_ quantities and all quantities _to be determined_. If possible, make a sketch.
    
2. Write a **primary equation** for the quantity that is to be maximized or minimized. (Several useful formulas from geometry are listed on the formula card for this text.)
    
3. Reduce the primary equation to one having a _single independent variable_. This may involve the use of **secondary equations** relating the independent variables of the primary equation.
    
4. Determine the feasible domain of the primary equation. That is, determine the values for which the stated problem makes sense.
    
5. Determine the desired maximum or minimum value by the calculus techniques discussed in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.
    

Remark

For Step 5, recall that to determine the maximum or minimum value of a continuous function on a closed interval, you should compare the values of at its critical numbers with the values of at the endpoints of the interval.

Using the secondary equation , rewrite the primary equation as

Because is smallest when the expression inside the radical is smallest, you need only find the critical numbers of . Note that the domain of is the entire real number line. So, there are no endpoints of the domain to consider. Moreover, the derivative of

and the dimensions of the page should be inches by inches.

Example 4

### Finding Minimum Length

Two posts, one feet high and the other feet high, stand feet apart. They are to be stayed by two wires, attached to a single stake, running from ground level to the top of each post. Where should the stake be placed to use the least amount of wire?

### Solution

Let be the wire length to be minimized. Using Figure 3.57, you can write

The quantity to be minimized is length. From the diagram, you can see that varies between and .

![An illustration depicts two posts of different heights. The height of the post on the left is 12 feet and the height of the post on the right is 28 feet. The distance between the two posts is 30 feet. One wire labeled y slopes down and to the right from the top end of the post on the left to a point on the ground, from which another wire labeled z slopes up and to the right to the top end of the post on the right. Both wires are attached to a stake on the ground at a distance of x from the post on the left, and 30 minus x from the post on the right. An equation beside reads, W = y + z.](https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/mathematics/larson_9780357749135/images/daaw_0001_0001_0_img0479-t2.png?token=960496A52B921DD34BC4366024459047606447605992A56563E710724ABB16CFBA6971AAF45EA302A3E236E01A4BF5AA6711F94936B8330E2FE6ACDEB27393B150DB2714E1B1FA96)

In this problem, rather than solving for in terms of (or vice versa), you can solve for both and in terms of a third variable , as shown in Figure 3.57. From the Pythagorean Theorem, you obtain

which implies that

So, you can rewrite the primary equation as

Differentiating with respect to yields

By letting , you obtain

Because is not in the domain and

you can conclude that the wires should be staked at feet from the -foot pole.

The vertical axis ranges from 45 to 60, in increments of 5. The curve enters the left of the viewing window, crosses the vertical axis at (0, 53), then goes down and to the right, reaches its low point at (9, 50), then goes up and to the right through the point (18, 53), and exits the top of the viewing window. The text below the screen reads, Minimum X = 9, Y = 50. All values are estimated.](https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/mathematics/larson_9780357749135/images/daaw_0001_0001_0_img0488-t2.png?token=960496A52B921DD34BC4366024459047606447605992A56563E710724ABB16CFBA6971AAF45EA302A3E236E01A4BF5AA6711F94936B8330E2FE6ACDEB27393B150DB2714E1B1FA96)

In each of the first four examples, the extreme value occurred at a critical number. Although this happens often, remember that an extreme value can also occur at an endpoint of an interval, as shown in Example 5.

Example 5

### An Endpoint Maximum

Four feet of wire is to be used to form a square and a circle. How much of the wire should be used for the square and how much should be used for the circle to enclose the maximum total area?

### Solution

The total area (see Figure 3.59) is

Figure 3.59

The quantity to be maximized is area:

![An illustration depicts a 4 feet wire coiled on a cylindrical core. Two arrows from the coiled wire point to a square and a circle on the right, respectively. The sides of the square are labeled x, the area of the square is x^2, and the perimeter is 4x. The circle of radius r has an area of the circle as pi r^2, and the circumference is 2 pi r.](https://college.cengage.com/nextbook/shared/mathematics/larson_9780357749135/images/daaw_0001_0001_0_img0489-t2.png?token=960496A52B921DD34BC4366024459047606447605992A56563E710724ABB16CFBA6971AAF45EA302A3E236E01A4BF5AA6711F94936B8330E2FE6ACDEB27393B150DB2714E1B1FA96)

Because the total length of wire is feet, you obtain

So, , and by substituting into the primary equation you have

The feasible domain is , restricted by the square’s perimeter. Because

the only critical number in is . So, using

you can conclude that the maximum area occurs when . That is, _all_ the wire is used for the circle.

Before doing the section exercises, review the primary equations developed in Examples 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The applications in these five examples are fairly simple, and yet the resulting primary equations are quite complicated.

You must expect that real-life applications often involve equations that are _at least as complicated_ as these five. Remember that one of the main goals of this course is to learn to use calculus to analyze equations that initially seem formidable.
