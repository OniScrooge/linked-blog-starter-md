## Limits at Infinity
This section discusses the “end behavior” of a function on an _infinite_ interval. Consider the graph of
$$f(x)=\frac{3x^2}{x^2+1}$$
as shown in Figure 3.32. Graphically, _f(x)_ appears to approach _3_ as _x_ increases without bound or decreases without bound. A numerical approach supports this conclusion, as shown in the table.

>The table suggests that _f(x)_ approaches _3_ as _x_ increases without bound $(x\to \infty)$. Similarly, _f(x)_ approaches _3_ as _x_ decreases without bound $(x\to -\infty)$. These **limits at infinity** are denoted by:
>Limit at negative infinity: $$\lim_{ x \to \infty } f(x)=3$$
>Limit at positive infinity: $$\lim_{ x \to \infty } f(x)=3$$
> >[!note] Remark
> >The statement $\lim_{ x \to \infty }f(x)=L$ or $\lim_{ x \to \infty }f(x)=L$ means that the limit exists __and__ the limit is equal to _L_.

To say that a statement is true as _x_ increases _without bound_ means that for some (large) real number _M_, the statement is true for _all_ _x_ in the interval ${x:x>M}$. The next definition uses this concept.

>When _L_ is a real number.
>1. The statement $\lim_{ x \to \infty }f(x)=L$ means that for each $e>0$ there exists and $M>0$ such that $\mid f(x)-L\mid<e$ whenever $x>M$
>2. The statement $\lim_{ x \to \infty }f(x)=L$ means that for each $e>0$ there exists and $N<0$ such that $\mid f(x)-L\mid<e$ whenever $x<N$
