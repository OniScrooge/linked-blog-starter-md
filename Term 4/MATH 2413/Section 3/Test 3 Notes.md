>[!faq]- Determine the interval(s) over which $f(x)=(x+3)^3$ is concave upwards.
>Plug into calculator
>Look at how it curves above the _x-axis_
>$$(-3,\infty)$$

>[!faq]- A carpenter is building a rectangular room with a fixed _perimeter_ of _180ft_. What are the dimensions of the largest room that can be built? What is its _area_?
>Figure out the pieces that you know
>- Perimeter is $180=2x+2y$ 
>- Area is $A=x*y$
>Solve for one of the formulas: 
>$$2x+2y=180$$
>Divide by _2_: $$x+y=90$$
>Subtract _x_: $$y=90-x$$
>Apply this to the opposite formula:
>Substitute in for _y_: $$A=x*(90-x)$$
>Distribute: $$A=90x-x^2$$
>This is a quadratic equation and you put it in order of highest exponent first $A=-x^2+90x$ and so it is a parabola to which the formula is $L=-\frac{b}{2a}$
>In our equation $A=−L^2+90L,A = -L^2 + 90L,A=−L^2+90L$:
>- $a=−1a = -1a=−1$ (the coefficient of $L^2$)
>- $b=90b = 90b=90$ (the coefficient of _L_)
>$$L=-\frac{90}{2(-1)}=\frac{90}{2}=45$$
>Now plug that back in for the area: $$(45)*(45)=A$$
>$$45*45=2025$$
>$$45ft,45ft;2025ft^2$$

>[!faq]- A company is constructing an _open-top_, _square-based_, rectangular metal tank that will have a volume of $41.5ft^3$. What dimensions yield the minimum surface area? (round to the nearest tenth)
>Figure out what information that you already know
>Open-top so _5_ sides
>Square-based so the based edges are all equal
>- $V=41.5$
>- Area of the base is $A=x^2$
>- Volume is $V=A*y$ or $41.5=x^2*y$
>Solve for one of the variables: $$y=\frac{41.5}{x^2}$$
>Now the base area plus the 4 vertical sides times the height: $A=x^2+4x*h$
>Substitute: $$A=x^2+4x*\frac{41.5}{x^2}$$
>Simplify: $$A=x^2+\frac{166}{x}$$
>Solve for _x_: $$x=^3\sqrt{ 83 }$$
>Calculate: $$x=^3\sqrt{ 83 }\approx 4.4ft$$
>Solve for other formula: $\frac{41.5}{x^2}=\frac{41.5}{(4.4)^2}\approx 2.2ft$
