# General
- All tests will be given in Canvas
- 2 meetings per week at 10am
- __NO MAKEUP EXAMS__
- Homework assignments are in WebAssign, make sure to check the due dates as they can vary
- There will be discussions as well, due dates can vary
- Scientific calculator is permitted
- __DON'T__ sign in to WebAssign from that site, sign in through Canvas
- Recordings of each meeting can be located in `Cisco Webex` > `Meetings` > `Completed`. Do note that it can take a couple hours for them to be uploaded.
- Feel free to asks questions in the `Student Lounge` or answer other's questions as well.
- Prefer to use Canvas to communicate with professor. Email can be used, just remember to include all details of who you are with them.
