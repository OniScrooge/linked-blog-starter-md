In calculus, much effort is devoted to determining the behavior of a [[function]] _f_ on an interval _I_. Does _f_ have a maximum value on _I_? Does it have a minimum value? Where is the [[function]] increasing? Where is it decreasing? In this chapter, you will learn how derivatives can be used to answer these questions. You will also see why these questions are important in real-life applications.

>[!info] Definition
>Let a [[function]] _f_  be defined on an interval _I_ containing _c_.
>
>1. $f(c)$ is the _minimum of __f__ on __I___ when $f(c)\leq f(x)$ for all _x_ in _I_.
>2. $f(c)$ is the _maximum of __f__ on __I___ when $f(c)\geq f(x)$ for all _x_ in _I_.

>The minimum and maximum of a [[function]] on an interval are the _extreme values_, or __extrema__ (the singular form of extrema is extremum), of the [[function]] on the interval. The minimum and maximum of a [[function]] on an interval are also called the _absolute minimum_ and absolute maximum, or the _global minimum_ and _global maximum_, on the interval. Extrema can occur at interior points or endpoints of an interval (see Figure 3.1). Extrema that occur at the endpoints are called _endpoint extrema_.
