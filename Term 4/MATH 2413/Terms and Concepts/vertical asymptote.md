A vertical [[remote-vault/Term 1/MATH-2412/Trigonometry/Important Terms/Asymptote]] of a graph is **a vertical line x = a where the graph tends toward positive or negative infinity as the inputs approach a**. A horizontal [[remote-vault/Term 1/MATH-2412/Trigonometry/Important Terms/Asymptote]] of a graph is a horizontal line y = b where the graph approaches the line as the inputs approach ∞ or –∞.
