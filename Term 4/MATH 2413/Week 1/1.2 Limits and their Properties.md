$f$ is undefined at x-1$$f(x)=\frac{x^3-1}{x-1}$$

The limit of $f(x)$ as _x_ approaches 1 is 3. __3__ is the limit of this [[function]].

>[!note] General Notation
>$$\lim_{ x \to c }f(x)=L$$

>[!faq]- Find the limit of $f(x)$ as x approaches 2, where: $f(x)=(1,x\neq 2)(0,x=2)$

>[!note] Existence
>When a right and left side limits are different, we state that the __limit does not exist__.

>[!info] Definition of Limit
>Let $f$ be a [[function]] defined on an open interval containing _c_ (except possibly at _c_), and let _L_ be a real number. The statement:
>$$\lim_{ x \to c }f(x)=L$$
>means that for each $\epsilon>0$ there exists a $\delta>0$ such that if:
>$$0<\mid x-c\mid<\delta$$
>then
>$$\\f(x)-L\mid<\epsilon$$

What to find in what order:
1. __L__ = plug in _c_ for _x_
2. __c__ = just below lim, what x is pointing to
3. $\epsilon$ = Given in problem
4. $\delta$ = Use $\mid x-c\mid$ and get what you have to fit that formula by multiplying/subtracting/adding/dividing to both sides
