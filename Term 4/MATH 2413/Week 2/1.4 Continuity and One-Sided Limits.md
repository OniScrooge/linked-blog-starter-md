## Continuity at a Point and on an Open Interval

>[!info] Continuity at a point
>![[Pasted image 20240908102614.png]]
>Three graphs representing the continuity at a point. The x axis has the markings a, c, and b, in order from left to right. A left parenthesis is at the marking a and a right parenthesis is at marking b. 
>
>Two vertical dashed lines are drawn at x = a and at x = b. (Graph 1) A curve enters from an open circle corresponding to the marking a, goes down to the right through an open circle, to an open circle, corresponding to the marking b, on the x axis. The text beside reads, f(c) is not defined. (Graph 2) A curve has two parts. 
>1. The first part of the curve starts from an open circle corresponding to the marking a, goes down and to the right, reaches its low point, then goes up and to the right to a closed circle corresponding to the marking c, on the x axis.
>2. The second part of the curve starts from the open circle corresponding to the marking c, goes up and to the right to the open circle corresponding to the marking b, on the x axis. The text beside reads, lim (x right arrow c) f(x) does not exist. (Graph 3) A curve starts from an open circle corresponding to the marking a, goes up and to the right, to an open circle, corresponding to the marking c, then goes down and to the right to another open circle corresponding to the marking b, on the x axis. A closed circle is plotted below the open circle, corresponding to the marking c. The text beside reads, lim_(x right arrow c) f(x) != f(c).
>
>In the figure above, it appears that continuity at _x = c_ can be destroyed by any of the three conditions.
>1. The [[function]] is not defined(full circle) at _x = c_
>2. The limit of $f(x)$ does not exist at _x = c_
>3. The limit of $f(x)$ exists at _x = c_, but is not equal to $f(c)$

>[!info] Definition of Continuity
>_Continuity at a Point_
>A [[function]] _f_ is __continuous at__ _c_ when these three conditions are met:
>1. $f(c)$ is defined
>2. $\lim_{ x \to c }f(x)$ exists
>3. $\lim_{ x \to c }f(x)=f(c)$
>
>_Continuity on an Open Interval_
>A [[function]] is __continuous on an open interval(a,b)__ when the [[function]] is continuous at each point in the interval. A [[function]] that is continuous on the entire real number line $(-\infty,\infty)$ is __everywhere continuous__.

>[!note] Greatest Integer [[Function]]
>Whenever you see $[\mid_{2.1}\mid]$ you are asked to find the __GIF__ of that number. This means to find the number that the number has reached from left to right $(-\infty\to \infty)$ left to right.
>
>In this example, $[\mid_{2.1}\mid]=2$
