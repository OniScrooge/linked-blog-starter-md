>[!info] Rolle's Theorem
>Let _f_ be [[continuous]] on the closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a,b)$. If $f(a)=f(b)$, then there is at least one number _c_ in $(a,b)$ such that $f'(c)=0$.

>[!info] The Mean Value Theorem
>If _f_ is [[continuous]] on the closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiate on the open interval $(a,b)$, then there exists a number _c_ in $(a,b)$ such that: $$f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$
