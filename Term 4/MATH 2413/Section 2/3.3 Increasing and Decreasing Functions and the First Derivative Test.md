## Increasing and decreasing functions

In this section, you will learn how derivatives can be used to _classify_ relative [[extrema]] as either relative minima or relative maxima. First, it is important to define increasing and decreasing functions.

>[!info] Definitions of Increasing and Decreasing Functions
>A [[function]] _f_ is __increasing__ on an interval when, for any two numbers $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ in the interval, $x_{1}<x_{2}$ implies $f(x_{1})<f(x_{2})$.

A [[function]] is increasing when, _as __x__ moves to the right_, its graph moves up, and is decreasing when its graph moves down. For example, the [[function]] in the _figure above_ is decreasing on the interval $(-\infty,a)$, is constant on the interval $(a,b)$, and is increasing on the interval $(b,\infty)$. As shown _below_, a positive [[derivative]] implies that the [[function]] is increasing, a negative [[derivative]] implies that the [[function]] is decreasing, and a zero [[derivative]] on an entire interval implies that the [[function]] is constant on that interval.

>1. If $f'(x)>0$ for all _x_ in $(a,b)$, then _f_ is increasing on $[a,b]$
>2. If $f'(x)<0$ for all _x_ in $(a,b)$, then _f_ is decreasing on $[a,b]$
>3. If $f'(x)=0$ for all _x_ in $(a,b)$, then _f_ is constant on $[a,b]$
> >[!note] Remark

### Example 1 - Intervals on which _f_ is increasing or decreasing

Find the open intervals on which $f(x)=x^3-\frac{3}{2}x^2$ is increasing or decreasing.

#### Solution
Not that _f_ is differentiable on the entire real number line and the [[derivative]] of _f_ is:
 Write original [[function]]: $$f(x)=x^3-\frac{3}{2}x^2$$
Differentiate: $$f'(x)=3x^2-3x$$
To determine the critical numbers of _f_, set $f'(x)$ equal to zero.

Set $f'(x)$ equal to _0_: $$3x^2-3x=0$$
Factor: $$3(x)(x-1)=0$$
Critical numbers: $$x=0,1$$
Because there are no points for which _f'_ does not exist, you can conclude that $x=0$ and $x=1$ are the only critical numbers. The table summarizes the testing of the three intervals determined by these two critical numbers.

By Theorem 3.5, _f_ is increasing on the intervals $(-\infty,0)$ and $(1,\infty)$ and decreasing on the interval $(0,1)$, as shown in Figure 3.16.

### Guidelines for finding intervals on which a [[function]] is increasing or decreasing

Let _f_ be [[continuous]] on the interval $(a,b)$. To find the open intervals on which _f_ is increasing or decreasing, use the following steps:
1. Locates the critical numbers of _f_ in $(a,b)$, and use these numbers to determine test intervals.
2. Determine the sign of $f'(x)$ at one test value in each of the intervals.
3. Use Theorem 3.5 to determine whether _f_ is increasing or decreasing on each interval.

These guidelines are also valid when the interval, $(a,b)$ is replaced by an interval of the form $(-\infty,b)$, $(a,\infty)$,  or $(-\infty,\infty)$.

### Strictly monotonic

A [[function]] is **strictly monotonic** on an interval when it is either increasing on the entire interval or decreasing on the entire interval. For instance, the [[function]] $f(x)=x^3$ is strictly monotonic on the entire real number line because it is increasing on the entire real number line, as shown in Figure 3.17(a). The [[function]] shown in Figure 3.17(b) is not strictly monotonic on the entire real number line because it is constant on the interval $[0,1]$.

## The [[First Derivative Test]]

After determining the intervals on which a [[function]] is increasing or decreasing, it is not difficult to locate the relative [[extrema]] of the [[function]]. For instance, in Figure 3.18 (from Example 1), the [[function]]:
$$f(x)=x^3-\frac{3}{2}x^2$$
has a relative maximum at the point $(0,0)$ because _f_ is increasing immediately to the left of $x=0$ and decreasing immediately to the right of $x=0$. Similarly, _f_ has a relative minimum at the point $\left( 1,-\frac{1}{2} \right)$ because _f_ is decreasing immediately to the left of $x=1$ and increasing immediately to the right of $x=1$. The next theorem makes this more explicit.

>[!info] Theorem 3.6
>Let _c_ be a critical number of a [[function]] _f_ that is [[continuous]] on an open interval _I_ containing _c_. If _f_ is differentiable on the interval, except possibly at _c_, then $f(c)$ can be classified as follows:
>1. If $f'(x)$ changes from negative to positive at _c_, then _f_ has a _relative minimum_ at $(c,f(c))$.
>2. If $f'(x)$ changes from positive to negative at _c_, then _f_ has a _relative maximum_ at $(c,f(c))$.
>3. If $f'(x)$ is positive on both side of _c_ or negative on both sides of _c_, then $f(c)$ is __neither__ a _relative minimum_ nor a _relative maximum_.

> >2. Locate the critical numbers of _f_ and use these numbers to determine the test intervals.
> >3. Determine the sign of $f'(x)$ at an arbitrary number in each of the test intervals.

### Example 2 - Applying the [[First Derivative Test]]

Find the relative [[extrema]] of $f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x-\sin x$ in the interval $(0,2\pi)$.

#### Solution

Note that _f_ is [[continuous]] on the interval $(0,2\pi)$. The [[derivative]] of _f_ is $f'(x)=\frac{1}{2}-\cos x$. To determine the critical numbers of _f_ in this interval, set $f'(x)$ equal to _0_.
Set $f'(x)$ equal to _0_: $$\frac{1}{2}-\cos x$$
Isolate _x-term_ on the left and multiply each side by _-1_: $$\cos x=\frac{1}{2}$$
Critical numbers in the interval $(0,2\pi)$: $$x=\frac{\pi}{3},\frac{5\pi}{3}$$
Because there are no points for which _f'_ does not exist, you can conclude that $x=\frac{\pi}{3}$ and $x=\frac{5\pi}{3}$ are the only critical numbers. The table summarizes the testing of the three intervals determined by these two critical numbers. By applying the [[First Derivative Test]], you can conclude that _f_ has a relative minimum at the point where $x=\frac{\pi}{3}$ and a relative maximum at the point where $x=\frac{5\pi}{3}$, as shown in Figure 3.19.

### Example 3 - Applying the [[First Derivative Test]]

Find the relative [[extrema]] of $f(x)=(x^2-4)^{2/3}$

#### Solution

Begin by noting that _f_ is [[continuous]] on the entire real number line. The [[derivative]] of _f_:

[[General Power Rule]]: $$f'(x)=\frac{2}{3}(x^2-4)^{-1/3}(2x)$$
Simplify: $$=\frac{4x}{3(x^2-4)^{1/3}}$$
is _0_ when $x=0$ and does not exist when $x=\pm 2$. So, the critical numbers are $x=-2$, $x=0$, and $x=2$. The table summarizes the testing of the four intervals determined by these three critical numbers. By applying the [[First Derivative Test]], you can conclude that _f_ has a relative minimum at the point $(-2,0)$, a relative maximum at the point $(0,^3\sqrt{ 16 })$, and another relative minimum at the point $(2,0)$, as shown in Figure 3.20.
