## Implicit and Explicit Functions

Up to this point in the text, most functions have been expressed in **explicit form.** For example, in the equation $y=3x^2+5$, the variable __y__ is explicitly written as a [[function]] of __x__. Some functions, however, are only implied by an equation. For instance, the [[function]] $y=\frac{1}{x}$ is defined **implicitly** by the equation:
Implicit Form: $$xy=1$$
To find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ for this equation you can write __y__ explicitly as a [[function]] of __x__ and then differentiate.

This strategy works whenever you can solve for the [[function]] explicitly. You cannot, however, use this procedure when you are unable to solve for __y__ as a [[function]] of __x__. For instance, how would you find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ for the equation:
$$x^2-2y^3+4y=2$$
For this equation, it is difficult to express __y__ as a [[function]] of __x__ explicitly. To find $\frac{dy}{dx}$, you can use **implicit differentiation.**

To understand how to find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ implicitly, you must realize that the differentiation is taking place with respect to __x__. This means that when you differentiate terms involving __x__ alone, you can differentiate as usual. However, when you differentiate terms involving __y__, you must apply the [[Chain Rule]], because you are assuming that __y__ is defined implicitly as a differentiable [[function]] of __x__.

To see how you can use an _implicit [[derivative]]_, consider the graph shown in the figure below. From the graph, you can see that y is not a [[function]] of x. Even so, the [[derivative]] found in the example above gives a formula for the slope of the tangent line at a point on this graph. The slopes at several points on the graph are shown below the graph.

>[!faq]- Find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ by implicit differentiation. Then find the slope of the graph at the given point: $$(3x+3y)^3=27x^3+27y^3,(-1,1)$$
>To find the implicit [[derivative]] of the given [[function]], we first take the [[derivative]] of both sides with respect to _x_. In this case, it happens to be easier if we first rewrite the given implicit [[function]] by expanding the left side of the equation and simplifying the result.
>Use [[Expanding a binomial]]: $$(3x+3y)^3=27x^3+27^3$$
>Subtract like terms: $$27x^3+81x^2y+81xy^2+27y^3=27x^3+27y^3$$
>Factor and divide __81__: $$81x^2y+81xy^2=0$$
>$$x^2y+xy^2$$
>Now we can take the [[derivative]] of both sides of the simplified implicit [[function]] with respect to __x__. This means for any term involving only the variable __x__, we take the [[derivative]] as normal. For any term involving __y__, as __y__ is a [[function]] of __x__, taking the [[derivative]] of __y__ with respect to __x__ is a special case of the [[Chain Rule]]. We note that the [[derivative]] of __y__ is not __1__, but $\frac{dy}{dx}$.

>By the additive property of the [[derivative]], we can find the [[derivative]] of each term of the left side of the equation $x^2y+xy^2=0$ separately. Each term requires the product rule.
>$$\frac{d}{dx}[x^2y]\to x^2\frac{d}{dx}[y]+y\frac{d}{dx}[x^2]\to x^2\frac{dy}{dx}+y(2x)$$
>$$\frac{d}{dx}[xy^2]\to x\frac{d}{dx}[y^2]+y^2\frac{d}{dx}[x]\to x(2y)\frac{dy}{dx}+y^2(1)$$
>The right side of the equation is __0__, so we have $\frac{d}{dx}[0]=0$. Therefore, setting the derivatives of each side of the simplified [[function]] equal to each other, we have the following.
>$$\left( x^2\frac{dy}{dx}+2xy\frac{dy}{dx} \right)+(2xy+y^2)=0$$
>$$\frac{dy}{dx}(x^2+2xy)=-(2xy+y^2)$$
>$$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{-2xy-y^2}{x^2+2xy}$$
>Finally, we are asked to find the slope of the graph at the point $(-1,1)$.
>Evaluate $\frac{dy}{dx}$ at $x=-1$ and $y=1$.
>$$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{-y(y+2x)}{x(x+2y)}$$
>$$\frac{-1(1+2(-1))}{-1(-1+2(1))}=-1$$
