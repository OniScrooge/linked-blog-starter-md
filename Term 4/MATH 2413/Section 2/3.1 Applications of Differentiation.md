# Summary
- Critical numbers are sometimes referred to as _critical values_. Let _f_ be defined at _c_. If $f'(c)=0$ or if is not differentiable at _c_, then _c_ is a **critical number** of _f_.
# Learning Objectives
- Define [[extrema]] of a [[function]] on an interval.
- Define relative [[extrema]] of a [[function]] on an open interval.
- Find [[extrema]] on a closed interval.

## [[Extrema]] of a [[function]]

>[!info] Definition of [[Extrema]]
>Let a [[function]] _f_ be defined on an interval _I_ containing _c_
>1. $f(c)$ is the __minimum__ of _f_ on _I_ when $f(c)\leq f(x)$ for all _x_ in _I_
>2. $f(c)$ is the __maximum__ of _f_ on _I_ when $f(c)\geq f(x)$ for all _x_ in _I_
>The minimum and maximum of a [[function]] on an interval are the **extreme values,** or **[[extrema]]** (the singular form of [[extrema]] is extremum), of the [[function]] on the interval. The minimum and maximum of a [[function]] on an interval are also called the **absolute minimum** and **absolute maximum,** or the **global minimum** and **global maximum,** on the interval. [[Extrema]] can occur at interior points or endpoints of an interval (see Figure 3.1). [[Extrema]] that occur at the endpoints are called **endpoint [[extrema]].**

>A [[function]] need not have a minimum or a maximum on an interval. For instance, in Figures 3.1(a) and (b), you can see that the [[function]] $f(x)=x^2+1$ has both a minimum and a maximum on the closed interval $[-1,2]$ but does not have a maximum on the open interval $(-1,2)$. Moreover, in Figure 3.1(c), you can see that continuity (or the lack of it) can affect the existence of an extremum on the interval. This suggests the theorem below. (Although the Extreme Value Theorem is intuitively plausible, a proof of this theorem is not within the scope of this text.)
