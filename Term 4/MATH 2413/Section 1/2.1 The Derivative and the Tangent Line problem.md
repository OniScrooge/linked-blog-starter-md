>[!abstract] What does it mean?
>To say that a line is _tangent_ to a curve at a point means, for a circle, the tangent line at a point __P__ is the line that is perpendicular to the radial line at point __P__, as show below:

>[!note] Slope of a secant line
>$$m_{\sec}=\frac{f(c+\Delta x)-f(c)}{\Delta x}$$

>[!note] Definition of the [[derivative]] of a [[function]]
>The __[[derivative]]__ of _f_ at _x_ is:
>$$f'(x)=\lim_{ \Delta x \to 0 }=\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$$

>[!faq]- Find the [[derivative]] of the [[function]] by the limit process: $f(x)=x^2-5$
>Used the formula above and plug in: $$f(x+\Delta x)=(x+\Delta x)^2-5$$
>$$f'(x)=\lim_{ \Delta x \to 0 } \frac{[(x+\Delta x)^2-5]-x^2-5}{\Delta x}$$
>Cancel like terms: $$\lim_{ \Delta x \to 0 } \frac{x^2+2x\Delta x+\Delta x^2--5-x^2+5}{\Delta x}=\frac{2x\Delta x+\Delta x^2}{\Delta x}$$
>Factor: $$\lim_{ \Delta x \to 0 } \frac{\Delta x(2x+\Delta x)}{\Delta x}$$
>Cancel like terms: $$\lim_{ \Delta x \to 0 } (2x+\Delta x)=2x$$

>[!note] The Alternative Form
>The alternative limit form of the [[derivative]] shown below is useful in investigating the relationship between differentiability and continuity. The [[derivative]] of _f_ at _c_ is: $$f'(c)=\lim_{ x \to c } \frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}$$
