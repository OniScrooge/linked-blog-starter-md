>[!note] Consider the following...
>The [[function]] $f(x)=\frac{3}{x-2}$. Notice that as __x__ approaches 2 both bounds will head towards infinity, as depicted in the picture below.

>
>This behavior is denoted as: $$\lim_{ x \to 2 } \frac{3}{x-2}=-\infty $$

>[!faq]- Find the vertical asymptotes, if any: $f(x)=\frac{3x}{x^2+9}$
>Notice that: $$x^2+9\neq 0$$
>So, there is none.

>[!faq]- Find the vertical asymptotes, if any: $f(x)=\tan \pi x$
>Notice that: $$y=\tan x$$
>So, the formula is: $$x=\frac{\pi}{2}+n\pi$$
>Where __n__ is any _integer_.
>And you can solve for $\pi x$: $$\pi x=\frac{\pi}{2}+n \pi$$
>Divide both sides by $\pi$: $$x=\frac{1}{2}+n$$

>[!faq]- Determine whether the graph of the [[function]] has a vertical [[asymptote]] or a [[removable discontinuity]] at $x=-1$: $$\frac{f(x)=x^2-2x-8}{x+1}$$
>Start by factoring the numerator: $$\frac{(x+2)(x-4)}{x+1}$$
>So at $-1$ the denominator would result in a __0__.
>As such, it continues infinitely. So the answer is that this is a Non-[[Removable Discontinuity]](__NRD__)

>[!faq]- Determine whether the graph of the [[function]] has a vertical [[asymptote]] or a [[removable discontinuity]] at $x=-1$: $$f(x)=\frac{\sin(x+1)}{x+1}$$
>To write the logic fully out: $$\lim_{ x \to -1 } f(x)=\lim_{ x+1 \to 0 } \frac{\sin(x+1)}{x+1}=\lim_{ y \to 0 } \frac{\sin y}{y}=1$$
>And this has a __RMD__ at $x=-1$
