## The Constant Rule

>[!info] Formula for the Constant Rule
>The [[derivative]] of a constant [[function]] is 0. That is, if _c_ is a real number then: $$\frac{d}{dx}[c]=0$$
>![[Pasted image 20240904100809.png]]
>A [[function]] of a horizontal line is graphed on an x y coordinate plane. Both axes are unmarked. The horizontal line f(x) = c, enters the left of the graph, crosses the positive y axis, goes rightward through the first quadrant, and exits the right of the graph. The text above the line reads The slope of a horizontal line is 0. The text below the line reads The [[derivative]] of a constant [[function]] is 0.
>
>Notice that the __Constant Rule__ is equivalent to saying that the slope of a horizontal line is 0. This demonstrates the relationship between slope and [[derivative]].

>-9 is a constant
>
>So following the constant rule, the [[derivative]] of the [[function]] is __0__.

## The Power Rule

You must understand how to expand a binomial for this rule.
![[Expanding a binomial]]

>[!info] Formula for the Power Rule
>If _n_ is a rational number, the the [[function]] $f(x)=x^n$ is differentiable and: $$\frac{d}{dx}[x^n]=nx^{n-1}$$
>For _f_ to be differentiable at $x=0$, _n_ must be a number such that $x^{n-1}$ is defined on an interval containing 0.

>[!faq] Find the [[derivative]] of $y=x^{12}$
>$x^{12}$ has a power
>
>So you need the __Power Rule__ $$y'=12x^{12-1}$$
>$$y'=12x^{11}$$

>[!faq] Find the [[derivative]] of the [[function]]: $y=\frac{1}{x^2}$
>Remember the formula, so just plug in: $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{d}{dx}[x^{-2}]=(-2)x^{-3}=-\frac{2}{x^3}$$

>[!faq] Use differentiation rules to find the [[derivative]] of the [[function]]: $f(x)=-9t^2+5t-3$
>Use the Power's Rule and Constant Rule: $$=-9(2)t^1+5(1)t^0-(0)$$
>Simplify: $$=-18t+5(1)-0$$
>$$=-18t+5$$

## The Constant Multiple Rule

>[!info] Formula for the Constant Multiple Rule
>If _f_ is a differentiable [[function]] and _c_ is a real number, then _cf_ is also differentiable and: $$\frac{d}{dx}[cf(x)]=cf'(x)$$

>[!faq] Example $y=5x^3$
>$$\frac{dy}{dx}$$
>$$=\frac{d}{dx}[5x^3]$$
>$$=5\frac{d}{dx}[x^3]$$
>$$=5(3)x^2=15x^2$$


## The Sum and Difference Rules

>[!info] Formula for the Sum and Difference Rules
>The sum(or difference) of two differentiable functions _f_ and _g_ itself differentiable. Moreover, the [[derivative]] of _f_ + _g_ (of _f_ - _g_) is the sum (or difference) of the derivatives of _f_ and _g_.
>
>Sum Rule: $$\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)+g(x)]=f'(x)+g'(x)$$
>Difference Rule: $$\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)-g(x)]=f'(x)-g'(x)$$

>Cosine: $$\frac{d}{dx}[\sin x]=\cos x$$
>Sin: $$\frac{d}{dx}[\cos x]=-\sin x$$
