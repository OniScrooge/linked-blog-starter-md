## The product rule
In Section 2.2, you learned that the [[derivative]] of the sum of two functions is simply the sum of their derivatives. The rules for the derivatives of the product and quotient of two functions are not as simple.

>[!info] The Product Rule
>The product of two differentiable functions _f_ and _g_ is itself differentiable. Moreover, the [[derivative]] of _fg_ is the first [[function]] times the [[derivative]] of the second, plus the second [[function]] times the [[derivative]] of the first.
>$$\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)]=f(x)g'(x)+g(x)f'(x)$$
>or as some people prefer
>$$\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)]=f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x)$$
>__DO NOT DIFFERENTIATE BOTH SIDES AT THE SAME TIME__

>[!faq]- Find the [[derivative]] of $h(x)=(3x-2x^2)(5+4x)$
>$$h'(x)=(3x-2x^2)\frac{d}{dx}[5+4x]+(5+4x)\frac{d}{dx}[3x-2x^2]$$
>$$=(3x-2x^2)(4)+(5+4x)(3-4x)$$
>$$=(12x-8x^2)+(15-8x-16x^2)$$
>$$=-24x^2+4x+15$$

>Equations in four lines. (line 1). $h \prime (x) = (3x minus 2x^2) (d/d x) [5 + 4x] + (5 + 4x) (d/d x) [3x minus 2x^2]$. The expression $(3x-2x^2)$ on the right side of the equation is labeled, First. The expression $\left( \frac{d}{dx} \right) [5 + 4x]$ on the right side of the equation is labeled, [[Derivative]] of second. The expression $(5 + 4x)$ on the right side of the equation is labeled, Second. The expression $\left( \frac{d}{dx} \right) [3x-2x^2]$ on the right side of the equation is labeled, [[Derivative]] of first. The text beside line 1 reads, Apply Product Rule. (line 2). $=(3x-2x^2)(4)+(5+4x)(3-4x)$. The text beside the equation reads, Find the derivatives. (line 3). $=(12x-8x^2)+(15-8x-16x^2)$. The text beside the equation reads, Multiply. (line 4). $-24x^2+4x+15$. The text beside the equation reads, Simplify. 

>[!faq]- Find the [[derivative]] of $y=3x^2\sin x$
>Apply the product rule: $$\frac{d}{dx}[3x^2\sin x]=3x^2\frac{d}{dx}[\sin x]+\sin x\frac{d}{dx}[3x^2]$$
>Find the individual derivatives: $$=3x^2\cos x+(\sin x)(6x)$$
>$$=3x^2\cos x+6x\sin x$$
>Factor: $$=3x(x\cos x+2\sin x)$$

## The Quotient Rule

>[!info] The Quotient Rule
>The quotient $\frac{f}{g}$ of two differentiable functions _f_ and _g_ is itself differentiable at all values of _x_ for which $g(x)\neq 0$. Moreover, the [[derivative]] of $\frac{f}{g}$ is given by the denominator times the [[derivative]] of the numerator minus the numerator times the [[derivative]] of the denominator, all divided by the square of the denominator.
>
>When $g(x)\neq 0$: $$\frac{d}{dx}\left[ \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right]=\frac{g(x)f\prime(x)-f(x)g\prime(x)}{[g(x)]^2}$$

>[!faq]- Find the [[derivative]] of $y=\frac{5x-2}{x^2+1}$
>Apply quotient rule: $$\frac{d}{dx}\left[ \frac{5x-2}{x^2+1} \right]=\frac{(x^2+1)\frac{d}{dx}[5x-2]-(5x-2)\frac{d}{dx}[x^2+1]}{(x^2+1)^2}$$
>Find the derivatives: $$\frac{(x^2+1)(5)-(5x-2)(2x)}{(x^2+1)^2}$$
>Multiply: $$\frac{(5x^2+5)-(10x^2-4x)}{(x^2+1)^2}$$
>Simplify: $$\frac{-5x^2+4x+5}{(x^2+1)^2}$$
>
>A liberal use of parentheses is recommended for all types of differentiation problems. For instance, with the Quotient Rule, it is a good idea to enclose all factors and derivatives in parentheses and to pay special attention to the subtraction required in the numerator.

The text beside line 5 reads, Write second form. (line 6) $y\prime=-csc(x)cot(x)+csc^2(x)$. The text beside line 6 reads, [[Derivative]] with respect to x. 


## High-Order Derivatives

Just as you can obtain a velocity function by differentiating a position function, you can obtain an **acceleration** function by differentiating a velocity function. Another way of looking at this is that you can obtain an acceleration function by differentiating a position function _twice_.

- Position function: $s(t)$
- Velocity function: $v(t) = s'(t)$
- Acceleration function: $a(t)=v'(t)=s''(t)$

The function $a(t)$ is the __second derivative__ of $s(t)$ and is denoted by $s''(t)$.

The second derivative is an example of a **higher-order derivative.** You can define derivatives of any positive integer order. For instance, the **third derivative** is the derivative of the second derivative. Higher-order derivatives are denoted as shown below.

- First derivative: $y',f'(x),\frac{dy}{dx},\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)],D_{x}[y]$
- Second derivative: $y'',f''(x),\frac{d^2y}{dx},\frac{d^2}{dx^2}[f(x)],D_{x}^2[y]$
- Third derivative: $y''',f'''(x),\frac{d^3y}{dx^3},\frac{d^3}{dx^3}[f(x)],D_{x}^3[y]$
- Fourth derivative: $y'''',f''''(x),\frac{d^4y}{dx^4},\frac{d^4}{dx^4}[f(x)],D_{x}^4[y]$
- Fifth derivative: $y''''',f'''''(x),\frac{d^5y}{dx^5},\frac{d^5}{dx^5}[f(x)],D_{x}^5[y]$

>[!note]
>The second derivative of a function is the derivative of the first derivative of the function.

>[!faq] Example
>Because the moon has no atmosphere, a falling object on the moon encounters no air resistance. In 1971, astronaut David Scott demonstrated that a feather and a hammer fall at the same rate on the moon. The position function for each of these falling objects is: $$s(t)-0.81t^2+2$$
>where $s(t)$ is the height in meters and $t$ is the time in seconds, as shown in the figure at the right. What is the ratio of Earth’s gravitational force to the moon’s?
>![[Pasted image 20240915201214.png]]
>
>Solution:
>To find the acceleration, differentiate the position function twice.
>- Position function: $s(t)=-0.82t^2+2$
>- Velocity function: $s'(t)=-1.62t$
>- Acceleration function: $s''(t)=-1.62$
>Because $s''(t)=-g$, the acceleration due to gravity on the moon is $g=1.62$ meters per second per second. The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is $9.8$ meters per second per second, so the ratio of Earth’s gravitational force to the moon’s is: $$\frac{Earth}{Moon}=\frac{9.8}{1.62}\approx 6.0$$
>The moon’s mass is $7.349*10^{22}$ kilograms, and Earth’s mass is $5.976*10^{24}$ kilograms. The moon’s radius is $1737$ kilometers, and Earth’s radius is $6378$ kilometers. Because the gravitational force on the surface of a planet is directly proportional to its mass and inversely proportional to the square of its radius, the ratio of the gravitational force on Earth to the gravitational force on the moon is: $$\frac{5.976*10^{22}/6378^2}{7.349*10^{24}/1737^2}\approx 6.0$$
