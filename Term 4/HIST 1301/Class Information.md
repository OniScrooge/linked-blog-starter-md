# Writing Essays
For this history class, here is the essay format that you will need to follow for all of your essay assignments.  

Your essay will consist of four parts, the INTRODUCTION  (3-5 sentences,) the THESIS (1 sentence containing THREE separate points), the BODY of your paper (3 paragraphs that correspond to your 3 points), and a CONCLUSION, which wraps everything up. Don't forget a Works Cited page at the end.  

## INTRODUCTION
This is where you introduce your topic.  You need 3-5 sentences discussing what you will be writing about.   Don’t go off on tangents, and try to make it as interesting as possible. You can include a quote here, but if you do, make sure that you _begin_ your introduction with the quote, and put it above the paragraph. Unless specifically called for, don't use first person (I).  

“_And I said to the man who stood at the gate of the year:  
‘Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown_.’” (_King George VI, Christmas Speech_, _1939_)

## THESIS 
This is the heart of your essay.  This should be the first thing that you write – and stick to it. This will help you avoid getting off track.  Keep referring back to it when writing your paragraphs.  You need THREE points in your THESIS for this essay, and the points need to answer the question the essay is answering.  The THESIS is ONE sentence only, and it comes at the END of the INTRODUCTION. 

## BODY
This consists of three paragraphs.  Your first paragraph corresponds with the first point of your THESIS, the second paragraph with the second point, and third paragraph with the third point.  If you keep your THESIS in front of you while you write your paragraph, you can keep looking at your point to make sure that everything in your paragraph helps to support the point that you are making. Each paragraph needs to have about 4-5 sentences in it.

## CONCLUSION
Basically summarize the paper in 3-5 sentences. 

## Essentially
You are going to tell me what you’re going to say in your paper (INTRODUCTION, THESIS), say it (BODY), and then tell me what you just said (CONCLUSION).   😊

It is very important that you cite your sources properly in the text.  The citation comes immediately after the quote or fact that you use, and needs to include the author's name and page number of the book/article you got your information from.  You will still need a works cited page.  Here is yet another link to the Purdue Owl, so that you can be sure to cite your material the right way and not have to deal with plagiarism issues.

# Research Paper Guidelines
1. Your paper needs to be 5 pages, typed and double spaced, with 1" margins, and 12 point font.  You need to use a normal font, like Arial or Times New Roman, nothing funky!   Please put your name, the class time, and the title of your paper on the top left hand side of your paper.                                                                                                                
2. Your topic needs to be on something that interests you, and concerns the time covered in this course, basically, U.S. History from 1585 to 1865. You will need to use at least 6 sources.  Three of them must be books, the rest can be online.  At least three sources must be primary, the rest secondary sources.  A primary source is one that is written during the time that your subject lived or your event occurred.   For instance, if you were going to write on the Salem Witch Trials, you could use the actual trial proceedings as a primary source.  A secondary source is one written after the fact, something like Carol Karlsen’s book _The Devil in the Shape of a Woman_. The Internet may be used with **a** **great deal of discretion**; not everything on a site may be historically accurate.  If you have questions about using the Internet, please contact me.                   
3. You will need a bibliography (works cited) page and footnotes/endnotes. Unless you are a history major, you may use the MLA format for both.  If you are a history major, you will need to use the Chicago Manual style.  Both can be found at the Purdue Owl:

6. **Do NOT plagiarize**. Do NOT buy a research paper.   Everything must be in your own words; do not paraphrase someone else’s work and try to pass it off as your own.  That is still plagiarism, and you will fail if you do so.  Your papers must be written in Microsoft Word format, if they are submitted in any other format they will not be accepted, and you will receive a 0 for the assignment.  You also need to submit your work on time, as late papers will not be accepted either.

# Primary Source Guidelines

For the Primary Source Assignments, you need to use the primary sources provided, not some random stuff you found on the internet!  If necessary, and with great discretion, you can use information from the internet to back up what the primary source has said, but make sure the site is valid (i.e. it has an `.edu` extension) and that you only use a small bit.  

You need to focus directly on the questions themselves; don't get sidetracked into discussing something that doesn't pertain directly to the question.  (It will help you if you make an outline!) 

When working with Primary Source documents, you have to use the material itself or it doesn’t count, as it then becomes a Secondary Source project, or whatever.  

Since it's a major grade, your Primary Source Assignments need to be in essay format.  You will need to write an essay consisting of 5 paragraphs, complete with introduction, thesis, 3 body paragraphs, and a conclusion for each question.  (A paragraph has **at least 5** sentences!)   I'm not concerned about page length or word count, so don't worry about that.  If you're not sure how to write an essay, please see the guide posted in the Modules section.  

Primary Sources are incredibly important in history; they are first hand accounts of events that happened a long time ago!

If you have any questions, please post them in the Student Lounge, so that others can see them as well.  You have a week to get each Primary Source Assignment done, so please be sure to do them on time.  Late assignments will not be accepted.

# Analyzing a Primary Source

When you analyze a primary source, you are undertaking the most important job of the historian. There is no better way to understand events in the past than by examining the sources--whether journals, newspaper articles, letters, court case records, novels, artworks, music or autobiographies--that people from that period left behind.

Each historian, including you, will approach a source with a different set of experiences and skills, and will therefore interpret the document differently. Remember that there is no one right interpretation. However, if you do not do a careful and thorough job, you might arrive at a wrong interpretation.

In order to analyze a primary source you need information about two things: the document itself, and the era from which it comes. You can base your information about the time period on the readings you do in class and on lectures. On your own you need to think about the document itself. The following questions may be helpful to you as you begin to analyze the sources:
1. Look at the physical nature of your source. This is particularly important and powerful if you are dealing with an original source (i.e., an actual old letter, rather than a transcribed and published version of the same letter). What can you learn from the form of the source? (Was it written on fancy paper in elegant handwriting, or on scrap-paper, scribbled in pencil?) What does this tell you?
2. Think about the purpose of the source. What was the author's message or argument? What was he/she trying to get across? Is the message explicit, or are there implicit messages as well?
3. How does the author try to get the message across? What methods does he/she use?
4. What do you know about the author? Race, sex, class, occupation, religion, age, region, political beliefs? Does any of this matter? How?
5. Who constituted the intended audience? Was this source meant for one person's eyes, or for the public? How does that affect the source?
6. What can a careful reading of the text (even if it is an object) tell you? How does the language work? What are the important metaphors or symbols? What can the author's choice of words tell you? What about the silences--what does the author choose NOT to talk about?

>[!note] Now you can evaluate the source as historical evidence
>1. Is it prescriptive--telling you what people thought should happen--or descriptive--telling you what people thought did happen?
>2. Does it describe ideology and/or behavior?
>3. Does it tell you about the beliefs/actions of the elite, or of "ordinary" people? From whose perspective?
>4. What historical questions can you answer using this source? What are the benefits of using this kind of source?
>5. What questions can this source NOT help you answer? What are the limitations of this type of source?
>6. If we have read other historians' interpretations of this source or sources like this one, how does your analysis fit with theirs? In your opinion, does this source support or challenge their argument?

Remember, you cannot address each and every one of these questions in your presentation or in your paper, and I wouldn't want you to. You need to be selective.
